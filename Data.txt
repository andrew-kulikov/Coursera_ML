I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever\nfelt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.\nThis is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear\nof getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is\nhopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did\nnot answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,\na lie.

So .. ?\n\nI suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe\nand analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\n\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit\nthat I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.\n\n> No one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let\n> me ask you a question.

I learned what it means to use _reason_.\n\nAs a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis\nof a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n> The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n> As much\n> as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and \n> what not to?\n\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\nevidence. \n\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\n\n> There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.

Those who do are usually remembered\nas heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm\nlying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is \nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\n\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing.

We have\n> two hypotheses H and HG - the latter is more "complicated", which by\n> definition means P(H) > P(HG).\n\nThat ("complicated") isn\'t in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it\'s more\nthe other way around. It\'s from\n\n  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG\')  where G\' is the complement of G\n\nand by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG\') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).\n\nIn a sense, HG is necessarily more "complicated" than H for any H and G,\nso I may be splitting hairs, but what I\'m trying to say is that irrespective\nof subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)\nholds, with equality if and only if P(HG\') = 0.\n\n> As you point out, it\'s a very simple matter to show P(x | H) = P(x | HG)\n> ==> P(H | x) > P(HG | x), and thus H is to be preferd to HG. Now to say\n> that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P(x | H) =  P(x | HG).\n> Can you elaborate some on this.\n\nWell, "P(x | A) = P(x | B)" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is\noperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\n\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\n\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\n\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\n\nSo A and B are "equally consistent with the data" in that observing x\ndoesn\'t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\n\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don\'t know\nthe actual values, and it\'s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\nthrow out any such HG.\n\n> Also, in the "real world" it isn\'t as clear cut and dry it seems \n> to me. We can\'t always determine whether the equality "P(x | H) =  \n> P(x | HG)" is true. \n\nThat\'s certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or\nnot a `divine component\' actually underlies the prevalence of religion\nin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious\nimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word\'.\n\nNow it seems to me, as I\'ve said, that the observed variance in religious\nbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather\n*less* well if one proposes a `divine component\' in addition, since I would\nexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual\nexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn\'t\neven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,\nG is `divine component\', x is the variance among beliefs).

I\'m not a Baysian statistician (nor any type of \n> statistician), so this would be very helpful. \n\nNot that I\'m a statistician as such either, but:\n\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\nthe (read `my\') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\nmeasurable ways.\n\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \nwhich I loosely termed "appearances of god/s", have some nonzero\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\n\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\nexpends on making "appearances of god/s" possible must come from somewhere\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\n\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn\'t* an\n"appearance of god/s" must have a slightly higher probability under\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\n\nSorry if that\'s still a bit jargonesque, but it\'s rather difficult to\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\narea under them is always unity.\n\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is "the\ncoin is fair", and that B is "the coin is unfair (two-headed)". (I\'ve\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\n\nThen\n\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\n\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\n\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\ndon\'t actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\nof heads.\n\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\nmodified according to\n\n                            P(H | A)\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\n                              P(H)\n\nand\n\n                            P(H | B)\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\n                              P(H)\n\nNow we don\'t know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\n\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\n\n                 n\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\n\nand\n                    n\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\n\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\n\nThe loose analogy is between "unfair coin" and atheism, and between "fair\ncoin" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\nwould falsify "unfair coin", is analogous to an "appearance of god/s",\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\nis the same.\n\n>> Constant observation of no evidence for gods, if evidence for them \n>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>> is at all possible under the respective theisms, constantly increases\n>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>> the notional estimated probability that they don\'t exist, \n\n> It\'s important to draw a distinction between theism that could\n> be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can\'t.\n> Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible,\n> it doesn\'t make sense to say "lack of evidence" supports the contrary \n> view.\n\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call "the G in the HG",\nin terms of our Ockham\'s Razor discussion, and I\'d bin it on those grounds.\n\n> So it depends upon your conception of this god.

We don\'t need, in the above analogy, to know *any*\nprior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the\nfair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding\nmultiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.\nYou don\'t need to know the initial values of the running estimates\neither. It\'s clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)\napproaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.\n\nAll you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for\nobserved x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain\nevents rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible\nunder Ha, and all else is equal.\n\n> Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations.

(Before somebody points out that quantum\nmechanics doesn\'t make this prediction either, the difference is that\nQM and atheism do not form a partition.)\n\nPredictions include such statements as "Prayer is efficacious" (implying\n"If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious"), or "Prayer\nis *not* efficacious", or "Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not\npass, till all these things be fulfilled."

This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of\nheads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite\nnumber of tosses to falsify X in the limit.

Some wonder whether or not the moon could\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\n\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\nam not a diving expert).\n\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,\nthe Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a \npressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book "Brainsex" by\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\nand is well referenced. \n\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\n\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\n\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\nsexism here just reflects the "sexism" of nature in making men and women\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\nrecommend you have a look at the book "Brainsex".\n\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\n\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.

Science is not based on and does not consist of "quotes" from either\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\n\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\n    not be your real intent.\n\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of "the modern theory of\n    evolution" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\n\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\n\n\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\n\n * Neither I, nor Webster\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.

Francis Hitchings\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ("The Neck of\nthe Giraffe").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a "non sequitur" (i.e.\nthe conclusion "does not follow"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\n\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\ntitled "`Giraffe\' sticks scientific neck out too far".  Excerpts include :\n\n  "Francis Hitchings is not a biologist."  "He goes after Darwin like Mark\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman."  "He suggests\n  a mystical `organizing principle\' of life, using the similarity of organs\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic]."\n\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\nagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn\'t\nsurprise me much.  It\'s also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.\nhe only posted a quote).\n\n\n  UUCP:  uunet!tektronix!sail!mikec  or                  M.Cranford\n         uunet!tektronix!sail.labs.tek.com!mikec         Principal Troll\n  ARPA:  mikec%sail.LABS.TEK.COM@RELAY.CS.NET            Resident Skeptic\n  CSNet: mikec@sail.LABS.TEK.COM                         TekLabs, Tektronix\n\n', 'From: darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice)\nSubject: Islam and Sufism (was Re: Move the Islam discussions...)\nOrganization: Monash University, Melb., Australia.\nLines: 18\n\n(Short reply to Kent Sandvik\'s post remarking how it is strange that\nsomehow Sufism is related to Islam, as [to him] they seem quite\ndifferent.)\n\nIf one really understands Islam, it is not strange that Sufism is\nassociated with it.

What I completly disagree with is seperating that\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem.

These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\n: These days is just ain\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\'s sex &c (but that\'s \n: another arguement...) so it\'s more of a "lifestyle" decision.  Again by\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \n: as "unnatural" as each other.\n\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental.

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n', "From: 18084TM@msu.edu (Tom)\nSubject: Space Clippers launched\nX-Added: Forwarded by Space Digest\nOrganization: [via International Space University]\nOriginal-Sender: isu@VACATION.VENARI.CS.CMU.EDU\nDistribution: sci\nLines: 14\n\n\n\n>  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY\n\nWhen I first saw this, I thought for a second that it was a headline from\nThe Star about the pliers found in the SRB recently.\n\nY'know, sometimes they have wire-cutters built in :-)\n\n-Tommy Mac\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\\\ As the radius of vision increases,\n18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\\\ the circumference of mystery grows.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "From: rdouglas@stsci.edu (Rob Douglas)\nSubject: Re: HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days\nOriginator: rdouglas@phaedrus.stsci.edu\nOrganization: Space Telescope Science Institute\nLines: 44\n\n\nIn article <1993Apr28.171915.5013@mksol.dseg.ti.com>, mccall@mksol.dseg.ti.com (fred j mccall 575-3539) writes:\n|> In <1993Apr28.141606.17449@lambda.msfc.nasa.gov> bday@lambda.msfc.nasa.gov (Brian Day) writes:\n|> \n|> >rdouglas@stsci.edu (Rob Douglas) writes:\n|> \n|> >>[...]  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the \n|> >>back and you could have problems.

Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\nwasn\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\nof "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \nwe are expected to swallow that "hundreds of thousands" of \n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \nWhat hogwash.  If "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilians died, \nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \nthe Allied bombing.\n\nRegards,\n\nJim B.\n\n\n', "From: 18084TM@msu.edu (Tom)\nSubject: Level 5?\nX-Added: Forwarded by Space Digest\nOrganization: [via International Space University]\nOriginal-Sender: isu@VACATION.VENARI.CS.CMU.EDU\nDistribution: sci\nLines: 13\n\n\nNick Haines sez;\n>(given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in\n>maturity, I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case).\n\nLevel 5?

Unlike the conventional large \nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \nand results are discussed.\n\n\nEquatorial radar system\nFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU\n(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)\n(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,\nWorkshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,\nEspoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research\n(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.\n     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent \nscatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 \nkm altitude is now being designed in Japan.

It will have a PA product of about \n3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective \nantenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of \nthe MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam \nsteering within 20 deg from the zenith.

These aren\'t, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term\ndenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The\nrockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to\ndistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made\nammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines\nwith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A "D"\nengine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.\nAn "F" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a\ndoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size "O" are\navailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are\nshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of\nsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as\ncontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket\nengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)\n\nThere is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which\nholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities\n(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of\nRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved\nin HPR as well.

However, I do tend to materialism and\ndon\'t believe in absolute morality, so I\'ll answer your questions.\n\n>How then can an atheist judge value? \n\nAn atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according\nto a personal understanding of morality.  That I don\'t believe in an\nabsolute one doesn\'t mean that I don\'t have one.  I\'m just explicit,\nas in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express\njudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code\nrather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.\nMy moral code is not particular different from that of others around\nme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I\nobject to genocide, I\'m not expressing anything particularly out of\nline with what my society holds.\n\nIf your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it\ndoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral\ncode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity\nprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of\nour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving\nconsiderable survival advantages.  You\'d probably say that God just\nmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a\ncommon understanding about many moral issues.

In\nfact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by\nframing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear\nthat in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt\nto wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the\nquality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters\ncoexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An\nabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a\nBible they happen to agree with, and say "this is good", even if the\nact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in\nthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as\n"excluded from discussion", such that they "cannot participate", and\ntheir opinions given "no weight whatsoever" is the lowest form or\nreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort\nof someone who can\'t rationally defend their own ideas of right,\nwrong, and the Bible.\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n"Galactic Pot-Healer"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n"A Maze of Death"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n"VALIS"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n"The Divine Invasion"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n"The Handmaid\'s Tale"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\'s life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\'s right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n"The Bible"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\'ll know what all the fuss is\nabout.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\'s "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised\nedition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n"The Miracle of Theism", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for\nGod" such as Lelie\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin\'s works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.

And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\n\n\t\t\tJohn.\n", "From: urf@icl.se (Urban F)\nSubject: Re: Orion drive in vacuum -- how?\nNntp-Posting-Host: sw2001\nOrganization: None.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\n\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\ndiscoveries.\n\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\'s gravity\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\n\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\nSun\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\n\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\nand other "senses" of our automated spacecraft, color and\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\n\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\nachievements of the 20th century.\n     \n\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\n\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\'s (NASA\'s)\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\n\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\n\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\nbackup and supplemental power.\n\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\ncontrol spacecraft.\n\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\'s early seafarers\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\nspacecraft\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\nand the craft\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\n\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\n\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\n\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\nbodies.\n\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\n\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\n\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\'s\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\n\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\n\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\nthat allowed it to "see" through the planet\'s dense cloud cover\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\nradioed information about the planet\'s atmosphere during their\ndescent toward the surface.\n\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\nneighborhood and our own planet.\n     \n\nThe Sun\n\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\nmaterial left over from the Sun\'s formation. One hundred and nine\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\'s disk, and its\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\n\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\'s core is 15 million degrees\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\nis 340 billion times Earth\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\'s\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\n\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\n"red giant," it will suddenly collapse into a "white dwarf" --\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\nyears to cool off completely.\n\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\'s environment, but\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\'s gravity to\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\'s polar\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\n\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\nnever have developed on Earth.\n     \n\nMercury\n\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\nsolar system\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\n\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\nvisible on Earth\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\'s surface conditions prior to\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\n\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\'s interior\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\'s crust. The cliffs are as\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\nmiles).\n\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\ndensity of Earth\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\nand helium. When the planet\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\n\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\nSun! \n\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\nmake Mercury\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\'s core\nor those of any of the planets.\n\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\nplanet\'s surface.\n     \n\nVenus\n\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\' surface,\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\nrest.\n\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\'s\ninstruments measured the planet\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\n\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\n\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\ntransmit data for another hour.\n\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\nexample, Venus\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\nplanets.\n\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\' atmosphere (95 times as\ndense as Earth\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\nEarth\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\' atmosphere acts like a\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\nspace. As a result, the planet\'s average surface temperature is\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\nlead.\n\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\'s dense cloud cover and\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\nNASA\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\nof the surface.\n\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\'s flank is a\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\n\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\n\n     Venus\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\'\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\'s winds blow in\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\nalternating bands. Venus\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\n     \n\nEarth\n\n     As viewed from space, our world\'s distinguishing\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\n\n     Our planet\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\'s atmosphere protects\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\nthe early days of the solar system.\n\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\n\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\nplanet\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\nejected from the Sun. We\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\n\n     Besides affecting Earth\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\'s magnetic\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\'s\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\n\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\'s complex weather\nsystems.\n\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\nEarth\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\'s\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\nplanet in dangerous ways.\n     \n\nThe Moon\n\n     The Moon is Earth\'s single natural satellite. The first\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\n\n     NASA\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\n\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\'s\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\n\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\n\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\n\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\ncaptured by our planet\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\n     \n\nMars\n\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\nsystem\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\n\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\'s\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\n\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\n\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\n\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\n\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia ("Plains of Gold") showed a\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\ndunes.\n\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\'s soil\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\nthere.\n\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\n\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\n\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\nfog can form in valleys.\n\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\n\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\n\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\n\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\nEarth. NASA\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \n     \n\nAsteroids\n\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\norbits that cross Earth\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\nWinslow, Arizona.\n\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\ndiameter of our Moon. \n\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\n\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\'s left strikes\nEarth\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\n\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\nlike terrestrial rocks.\n\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\nseparated by very large distances.\n\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\nmaterials.\n     \n\nJupiter\n\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\nwas the first port of call.\n\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\'s\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\nduring flybys in 1979.\n\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\ncharacterize Jupiter\'s atmosphere.\n\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\nplanet\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\n\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\'s\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\nmillion years old.\n\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\'s upper\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\'s\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\n\n     Largest of the solar system\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\nminiature solar system.\n\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\nJupiter\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\nto Jupiter\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\n     \n\nGalilean Satellites\n\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\nplanet-sized satellites.\n\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\'s surface.\n\n     Io\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\nGalilean moons.\n\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\'s surface displays a\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\ncold of space. Europa\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\ncenter.\n\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\'s surface has areas of different\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\nthe moon\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\nsurface.\n\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\n\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\n     \n\nSaturn\n\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\'s atmosphere\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\'s somewhat placid-looking\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\nmiles) per hour.\n\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\'s ring\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\nAugust 1981.\n\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\norbiting individually around Saturn\'s equator at progressive\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\n\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\'s gravity. A\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\n\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\nthat make up the major rings.\n\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\'s ring system rather than its\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\'s auroras near\nSaturn\'s poles.\n\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\'s rings and the gaps\nin the rings. Saturn\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \n\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\'s in\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\nVenus. Titan\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\nUnfortunately, Voyager\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\'s\ndense clouds.\n\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\nconverting Titan\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\'s\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\n\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\nTitan\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\'s clouds and will\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\n     \n\nUranus\n\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\nground observations since the planet\'s discovery over two\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\n\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\'s flyby, the south pole\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\nsolar system.\n\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\' magnetic field does not follow\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\'s\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\n\n     Uranus\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\nvapor. The planet\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n     Uranus\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\nphotochemical "smog" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\nplanet\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as "electroglow."\n\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\'\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\n\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\n\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\nits interior exposed on its surface.\n\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\n11. In contrast to Saturn\'s rings, which are composed of bright\nparticles, Uranus\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\nboulder-sized chunks.\n     \n\nNeptune\n\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\'s moons. On\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\'s\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\'. \n\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\'s\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\nthe "Scooter," as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\nhour.\n\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\'s core\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\nother gas giants. Neptune\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\nUranus\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\n\n     Neptune\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\'s\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\nsimilar to Uranus\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\'s magnetic field, on the\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\n\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\'s rings.\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\nwere not spotted.\n\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\'s\nglare for observers on Earth.\n\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\naccompany the planet\'s modest current rings.\n\n     Triton\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\'s mantle is probably composed of\nwater-ice, but the moon\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\nterrain: the so-called "cantaloupe" terrain and a receding ice\ncap. \n\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\nthick as Earth\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\n     \n\nPluto\n\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\nNeptune\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\n\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\ncelestial snowball. The planet\'s diameter is calculated to be\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\'s\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\'s spin\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \n\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\n1978. Charon\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\'s: the\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\'s\nand Charon\'s rotational period and Charon\'s period of revolution\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \n\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\n     \n\nComets\n\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\n\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\n\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\nor cloud-like "head" that can measure tens of thousands of\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\nrise to the comet\'s "tails." Gases and ions are blown directly\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\nleft behind in a curved arc.\n\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning "long-haired" -- are essentially\ndramatic light shows.\n\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\nto the inner solar system.\n\n     Halley\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\' orbit.\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\nbecause he plotted the comet\'s orbit and predicted its return,\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\nsee it.\n\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\nappearance, Halley\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\n\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\'s International Cometary Explorer\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\nHalley\'s Comet in 1986.\n     \n\nConclusion\n\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\nneighbors in space. \n\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\nand beautiful places and objects.\n\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\n\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\'s complex weather\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\ninvestigating the Sun\'s activity and its influence throughout the\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\nprocesses on Earth.\n\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\nbelt.\n\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\nlunar base or a martian colony!\n\n- end -\n     \n', "From: schumach@convex.com (Richard A.

I\'ve \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\n\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \n"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions" here at the University of\nIllinois. Mr Nelson\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\'t think the details\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\nthey aren\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\n\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\n                  ______\n3 G         /|   /      |\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \n          /  | /        |\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\n       /                |          the graph wasn\'t up for very long.\n1 G   /                 |\n                        |\n                        |\n0 G                     |\n\n             ^          ^\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\n\n\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\nout entirely.\n\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \nthat desired.\n\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\n\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\n    all at once?\n\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\n\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\n\nA:  Can\'t tell us.  "Read Aviation Leak."  He also apparently had a good \n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \n\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\n\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\'s reentry profile about \n60 degrees south latitude.\n\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\'t know about that\naspect of the flight profile.\n\n-- \nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t    "Find a way or make one."\n\t             -attributed to Hannibal\n', 'From: rbunge@access.digex.net (Robert Bunge)\nSubject: Re: Vandalizing the sky.\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications Service, Greenbelt, Maryland USA\nLines: 27\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\nIn article <C69AGI.MJu@news.cso.uiuc.edu> jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins) writes:\n>I\'m wondering if "vandalize" is the proper word to use in this situation.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage."\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\'ll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t"relative wind") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle ("a negative q-alpha").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t"downward" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force "alleviates structural loading."\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\'re about the\n\tmost "delicate" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn\'t roll ("performance gain").\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site ("decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity").\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter ("improved S-band look angles").\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, "Why isn\'t the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the "top"\n    [Orbiter side] and the "bottom" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\'s.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V\'s also had a roll program.  Don\'t ask me why -- I\'m a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the "roll\n    maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It\'s worth asking if yours doesn\'t.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\n\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n\tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m\n\t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t-----\n\tW6FXN\t 145.46\n\tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840\n\tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860\n\tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840\n\tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\nenvironment.\n \nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\nObjectives:\n \n                           MISSION\n \n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\n   which we must all live.\n \n                         OBJECTIVES\n \n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\n   objectives shall be:\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\n            focus the education and participatory\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\n            of environmental concern;\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\n            their branches a full complement of program\n            materials for their use, including suitable\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\n            desirable;\n       (3)  To serve as a "clearing house" for the exchange\n            of program ideas, materials and information\n            among said organizations;  and\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate through three "Program Divisions" serving youth in\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\nthrough formation of "EnviroLeague Teams," either by EnviroLeague itself or by\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\n \nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\nyouth membership.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\n \nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the "draft"\nportions of the Mentor\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\nplace.\n \nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\'s founder chose this\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\nForums.\n \nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\'s Earth Forum - GO\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named "EnviroLeague."\n============================================================================\n \nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\nmeeting.

First let me say that when I say "intelligent"\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \nit\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\'s certainly not\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\nfor a putative technological alien.\n\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\nit\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\nwouldn\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\'s room\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\nlarge creatures. So there\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\'t rule out\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\n\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\'s internal heat is rapidly\nlost due to it\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\nthat must spend most of it\'s time and energy feeding won\'t have the time\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\nThe dinosaur\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\'s heat production \nbecause it\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \nI\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\nwould be capable of that much activity.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n', "From: nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu\nSubject: Re: Solar Sail Data\nArticle-I.D.: aurora.1993Apr17.042918.1\nOrganization: University of Alaska Fairbanks\nLines: 24\nNntp-Posting-Host: acad3.alaska.edu\n\nIn article <1993Apr15.051746.29848@news.duc.auburn.edu>, snydefj@eng.auburn.edu (Frank J.

(Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = "dark matter")\n\n  The earth isn\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun\'s image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\'s ether field, which is \nitself in the sun\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The "orbit" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\' images being dragged around\nby the sun\'s ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe "path" is not the same. The moon\'s lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as "earth\'s" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       /     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ /                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\'ve seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that "earth shadow.") Its only the moon\'s image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  "Light-Years" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The "piece" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\'d \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I\'d start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine\'s receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don\'t think you\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\'m curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept \'immortal\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n"advising" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn\'t remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\'s more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery \'adjustment\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, "its chaos!" They \nsaid, "no, its order." He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and \'vanishing\' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\'t eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\'ll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\'s cornered, and then he\'ll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\'re willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn\'t over play his hand, and he won\'t need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don\'t want to be a part of. \n\n  I don\'t claim to be the first to think these things, its just \nthat the others could have been \'pruned\' from our path.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, "It is\nraining" or "Today is Tuesday".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof "deny", not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So "God exists" and "There exists a\nGod" both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition".  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as "because",\n"since", "obviously" and so on.  (The phrase "obviously" is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn\'t seem obvious to you, don\'t be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say "Oh, yes, you\'re right, it is obvious" when\nyou\'ve heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as "implies that" or\n"therefore".\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as "therefore", "it follows that", "we conclude"\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God."\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\'ll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n"God created you; therefore do your duty to God."\n\nThe phrase "do your duty to God" is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form "A because\nB".  If we\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start." -- This is an argument.\n\n"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine."\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\'s premises are false. \nIf the argument\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a "truth table" for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion. \n"T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=>B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term "fallacy" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right". \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally "argument directed at the man".\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers."\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\'s\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent\'s particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?"\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent\'s argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou\'re white."\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\'s\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as "poisoning the well".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means "argument from ignorance".  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise."\n\n"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real."\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred."\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\'t find me\nguilty; I\'m suffering enough through being an orphan."\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women."\n\n"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"\nand\n"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer"\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose "accidental" circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists."\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere."\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache."\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons."\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice."\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services\' official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God."\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n"Have you stopped beating your wife?"\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n"Where did you hide the money you stole?"\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"\nor\n"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n"We should not speak ILL of our friends"\nand\n"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight."\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses."\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich."\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana."\n\n"A IS BASED ON B" FALLACIES / "IS A TYPE OF" FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n"Isn\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\'t the Bible also a form of\nhistory?"\n\n"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\'t Islam a\nform of Christianity?"\n\n"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\'t dogs a form of cat?"\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false", where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form "If A then B, therefore if B then A".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because "that\'s the way it\'s always been."\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An "argumentum ad nauseum" is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the "black and white" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\'s attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\'s position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."\n\n"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King."\n\n"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!"\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous "you too" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n"You\'re just being randomly abusive."\n"So?  You\'ve been abusive too."\n\nÿ\n', 'From: games@max.u.washington.edu\nSubject: Aerospace companies cooperate in reusable vehicle market.\nArticle-I.D.: max.1993Apr6.121843.1\nDistribution: world\nLines: 34\nNNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu\n\nWhat would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin\nMariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell)\ngetting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market\nprice pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say\n$3million to do that.

At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous\n    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near\n    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part\n    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They\n    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became\n    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle\n    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby\n    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were\n    visible till morning sunrise.\n\n    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in\n    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in\n    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was\n    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.\n    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a\n    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about\n    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the\n    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop\n    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of\n    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright\n    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails\n    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still\n    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.\n\n    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if\n    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near\n    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969\n    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of\n    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium\n    experiments and other chemical releases.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.

On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\n\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\nmeasurement has.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\n\n    If you don\'t want to see the FAQ, add \'Frequently Asked Questions\' to\nyour KILL file for this group (if you\'re not reading this with a newsreader\nthat can kill articles by subject, you\'re out of luck).\n\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\n\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\n\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\n\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\n\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\n    discussion.\n\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\n\n    Hope you aren\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\n\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\n\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\n    FAQ postings.\n\n\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\n\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you\'re on Usenet.\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\n    Edit "Subject:" lines, especially if you\'re taking a tangent.\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\n\t100 posts).\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\n\tnot SPACE.\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\n\treferences.)\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\'re\n\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\n\tor article), state your institution, etc. Don\'t assume the\n\t\'reply\' function of mailers will work.\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don\'t post what everyone\n\twill get on TV anyway.\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\n\tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\n\t(use carriage returns).\n\n\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\n\n    I\'ve attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn\'t\n    a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each\n    posting. Only those containing astronomy-related material are posted to\n    sci.astro (indicated by \'*\' following the posting number).\n\n    #\tContents\n\n    1*\tIntroduction\n\t    Suggestions for better netiquette\n\t    Index to linked postings\n\t    Notes on addresses, phone numbers, etc.\n\t    Contributors\n\n    2*\tNetwork resources\n\t    Overview\n\t    Mailing lists\n\t    Periodically updated information\n\t    Warning about non-public networks\n\n    3*\tOnline (and some offline) sources of images, data, etc.\n\t    Introduction\n\t    Viewing Images\n\t    Online Archives\n\t\tNASA Ames\n\t\tNASA Astrophysics Data System\n\t\tNASA Jet Propulsion Lab (Mission Information and Images)\n\t\tNASA Langley (Technical Reports)\n\t\tNASA Spacelink\n\t\tNational Space Science Data Center\n\t\tSpace Telescope Science Institute Electronic Info.

If that\'s correct, end of one point...\n\nGregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don\'t accept.\nHis comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him,\nand are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member\nof a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways\nof the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum.\nThe big bone of contention here that I\'m picking up is that in the West\nwe have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control\nand of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think\nthe majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn\'t say\n"in agreement") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the\nsecular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may\nhave chosen.\n\nWith that in mind, it not possible under secular law ("legally" as most\npeople would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once\nthey decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree\nthat there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there\nany secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past\ngroup member.\n\nA religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties\nof a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties\nin many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when\nthe enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person\n_in conflict with secular law_.\n\nThis is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular\nauthorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities.\nOutside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements\n_may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or\nmay not coincide with secular consequences (if any).\n\nRegards,\n\nDew\n-- \nDewey Henize Sys/Net admin RISC hardware (512) 891-8637 pager 928-7447 x 9637\n', "Subject: help for school\nFrom: mcrandall@eagle.wesleyan.edu\nOrganization: Wesleyan University\nNntp-Posting-Host: wesleyan.edu\nLines: 14\n\nI am a newbie to the net, and I am trying to get some information for a paper\nI am working on to get back into college.

The question\n> is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.\n\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth\'s\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\nanswer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\nby itself can\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\nthe resulting reduced material.\n\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\n\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\n\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\'s atmosphere\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\'t be here to be wondering about\nit.\n\n\tPaul F.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\'s main\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\nwill take particular claims at face value.\n\nImmanuel:\n\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\n\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  "[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\n       Joseph, will name him \'Jesus\' (which means G\'d is\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\n       sins."  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\n       spoken by a prophet:\n\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\n       lord G\'d said to Isaiah, "go to meet with Ahaz..." \n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n       naturally) saying, "Ask a sign of G\'d your lord.  It\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven."  But,\n       Ahaz said, "I won\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\n       test."  Then (Isaiah) said, "Hear then, O house of\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n       "Immanuel," which means, "G\'d is with us."   He will\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n       you dread will have been deserted...\n\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \nFurther, he the Hebrew word "almah," (young woman), as\nspecifically, "virgin."  But, this is not a prophecy about the\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\nlater Christians to be G\'d walking among men, was never called by\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n\nEgypt:\n\n       After Jesus\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n       "Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son."\n\n\nWhat the lord really said was this.\n\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\'als, and kept burning\n       incense to idols.\n\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\'s oracle.  But, it\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\'d.   Again, this prophecy\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n\nRachel Weeps:\n\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n       "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n       no more."   \n\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are "no\nmore."  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her "children,"\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem)."\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\'s life to enhance\nthe message of the church\'s gospel.\n       Because of the whole story\'s similarity to the tale of the\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The "children" the prophet\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\'d\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\nwould not suit Matthew\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\ndead for good.  Again, the "prophecy" Matthew sets up is not even\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\nconvincing.\n\nThe Nazarene:\n\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n       might be fulfilled, "He shall be called a Nazarene."\n\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who "He" is. \nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\'s mother that\nshe will,\n\n       [Judges 13.5]  "...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n       from the hands of the Philistines."\n\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\'d. \nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\nsimple making them up now.\n\nBearing our\nDiseases:\n\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\nand disabilities.\n\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n       prophet Isaiah, "He took our infirmities and bore our\n       diseases."\n\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\nof Israel, Jehovah\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\ninstrument of the nations\' salvation by G\'d.\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a "servant" going around and\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\'s parallel\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\n\n\nSilent Messiah:\n\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\'t arouse\nthe attention of the local rulers.\n\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \n\n       "Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n       name."\n\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n       await his law.\n\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the "light" of mankind\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\nG\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\nbe the children of G\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\nfrom the Judaic "...the coastlands await his law." to the\nChristologic, "the Gentiles will hope in his name."   While the\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\nto fit its strange doctrine of "believing in the name."  If one\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\nbut blind and imperfect servant, "a people robbed and\nplundered..."   So, we see that when Matthew\'s attempt at\n"prophecy" is examined, it crumbles.\n\nThree Days and\nThree Nights:\n\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\nresurrection.\n\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n       three nights.\n\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n6pm.  What was referred to as a "day" was the period of light from\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\'t forget that\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\n\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the "ninth\nhour," which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, "rose,"\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\'s little\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\ngod\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n\nHearing &\nUnderstanding:\n\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\naccept the "plain" message any better.  Matthew says,\n\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n\n       "You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n       people\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n       them."\n\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\'d,\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\'d said, "Go, and say to this\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n       see, but do not perceive.\'   Make the heart of this\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n       turn and be healed."  Then Isaiah said, "How long,\n       lord?"  And he said, "Until the cities lie waste\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\'ds take men far\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n       stands when the tree is felled." The holy seed is its\n       stump.\n\nHere we see that it is really G\'d who causes the people of Israel\nto stop listening to the prophet\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\npromise made to Solomon\'s (and David\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\nof G\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\nof Isaiah\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\'t\nunderstand Jesus\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\'s verses are\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\'d to him, in the\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \n\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\'s parables look like they\nhave the prophetic approval.\n\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n       prophet, "I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n       foundation of the world."\n\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n       lord...\n\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\nof Matthew\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\'s name as this prophet. \nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\nof it up.\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \nFurther, they speak of things "known, that our fathers have told\nus."  Jesus deals with things "hidden since the foundation of the\nworld."  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\nMatthew\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\'s prophecies aren\'t the\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n\n\nExcuses of\nLittle Faith:\n\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\nunable to "dispossess" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\nthey didn\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\nwoman\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\'t get to see\nGod anymore.\n\n       We\'re too lazy; we\'re not zealous enough; we\'re\n       sinful; it\'s just his "plan"; we put too many of our\n       own demands on G\'d\'s appearance; if we had the right\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\'d on his terms...\n\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\'d.  You, dear\nreader, have not seen G\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\ntrue. (I know that\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\'ve seen religions do is\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\'d.  They say\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\'d.  Sometimes, they\nsay, "See the love in these people you worship with... see the\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\'d."   Thus people get\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\'d into the everyday\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\'d as I am speaking of... it is\nnot seeing G\'d the way people used to see.  \n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\nhas little faith.\n\x0c\nJesus Rides on\nan Ass:\n\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\nJerusalem.  \n\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n       by the prophet, saying,\n\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your king is\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n       ass-colt."\n\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\ndifferently.\n\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n\nThere isn\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\'s version, we get a\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\n\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\'\n\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\nwas never one to point out such little "prophetic" things AND\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\nfit Matthew\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\nMatthew, "Haven\'t you read?" for the source reads,\n\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n       enemy and the avenger.\n\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no "perfect praise"\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\'d,\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\njust one more case of Matthew\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\nscripture.\n\nYHVH said to \nmy lord...:\n\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n\n       "The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n       I put your enemies under your feet."\n\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\'s tempting to believe this, if one\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \nBut, there are problems.\n       In Jesus\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\'s\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\'s time had\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\'s advent was imminent, and\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n\n       YHVH\'s utterance to my lord:\n\t"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n       footstool."\n\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n       holy mountains.  \n\n       "You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n       forever."\n\nThe word "lord" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\nword is "adoni," and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n"lord," a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\'d.  It is merely an\naddress of respect.  \n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\npsalm translates to either "a psalm of David," or "a psalm about\nDavid."  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\npoet, about David\'s covenant and endorsement from G\'d.  If the\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\nfrom David, was not present in David\'s age.  We have extensive\ntales of David\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\npraises of a messiah.\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\'d had put his show of\nfavour for David\'s kingdom on hold.  \n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\npromised by G\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\'s question.  As we\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n\nMoses & Jesus,\nHad it Together\nAll Along...:\n\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\npseudo-prophecy in John\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\nfrom the real events of Jesus\'s career as told by even Matthew. \nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\nby G\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\nwhich corresponds to John\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\nstill cling to it.\n\nThe Potter\'s\nField:\n\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n       priests, taking the silver, said, "It isn\'t lawful for\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n       money."  So they... bought a potter\'s field with it to\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n\n       "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\'s\n       field, as the lord directed me."\n\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\nMatthew makes use of.\n\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, "Cast\n       them to the treasury," --the lordly price at which I\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n       YHVH.\n\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\nof the messiah, or of G\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\nshortly before G\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\none another.  The word, "treasury," had been replaced by the King\nJames Scholars with "to the potter," precisely because this made\nMatthew\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed "treasury," which also\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\'s context, whereas "potter\'s\nfield" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\nMatthew\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\nintentional dishonesty.\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\'s situation, and if\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\nthe "prophecy" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\'s work is convincing\nenough.\n\nWine, Vinegar,\n& Casting Lots:\n\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n\n       "They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n       vesture did they cast lots."\n\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\n\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, "I thirst."  A bowl of\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n       had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished;"\n\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n       Book of the Living.\n\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\nwe run into further problem when we see that the "Jesus" in the\npsalm asks G\'d for the damnation of the "crucifiers," whereas the\nJesus of the gospels says,\n\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, the\n       don\'t know what they do!"\n\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\'s drink, not his\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\n\n       With the "prophecy" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\nask, "What of the casting of lots?"  This brings up the 22nd\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\nsay that the fact that Jesus\'s clothes were divided as told is no\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\nJesus\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\nsuspicions.\n\nThe 22nd Psalm:\n\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\nwill examine the primary passages.\n\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n       don\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like "the\nlamb led mute before its shearers."  Indeed, Jesus doesn\'t do much\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\nboth day and night on the cross.\n\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n       their heads;  "He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him."\n\nThis seems to fit Jesus\'s execution pretty well, with the\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\'m sure the early Christian\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words "have pierced" really\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n       hands and feet...\n\nIn Hebrew the phrase "like the lion" and a very rare verb form\nwhich can mean "pierced" differ by one phonetic character.  The\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, "like the lion" (ka\'ari),\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to "ka\'aru."   But, to\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the "prophecy" this is\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\ntranslators.\n\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\npsalm\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\nthe forearms.  This doesn\'t say much in favour of the traditional\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\n\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\ninterpretations of Jesus\'s life and death.  How much these\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\nhave been "enhanced" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\nthings for St. Matthew.\n\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\'s\ncrucifixion.  John\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\'s execution,\n\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n       "The will look on him whom they\'ve pierced."\n\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\nthem.\n\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n\nJohn\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\nMatthew\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\nthan just one passage.  John\'s errors are grossly obvious and\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\nreligion were founded.\n\n\x0c\nReckoned with\nTransgressors:\n\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n\n       "He was reckoned with the transgressors."\n\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\ntwo thieves would fulfill the "prophecy" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n\n       Mark goes on to tell us how "those who were crucified with\n[Jesus] also reviled him." [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n       with him railed, "Aren\'t you the messiah?! Save\n       yourself, and us!"\n\nThis certainly fits with Mark\'s recount, which tells how the\npeople who crucified Jesus said, "Save yourself!" and that the\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n       "Don\'t you fear G\'d, since you are under the same\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n       "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom." \n       And Jesus answered, "Verily I say to you, today you\n       will be with me in paradise."\n\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\'t seem likely to have\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\'s.  \nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\nwords of G\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\nseen.\n\nThe End of the\nWorld--\n       Mt. 24:\n\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\nwhich he has been warning about.\n\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\'s\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\n\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n       many will come in my name, saying, "I am the christ."  \n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n       the mountains.\n\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n       pass away until all these things take place...\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n       at an hour you do not expect.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\nthem that although he doesn\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\nswept away.\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, "this generation\nshall not pass away..." really means "this race of people will not\npass away..."  Of course, the word for generation is used many\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\nhe didn\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\nat the Apostles\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\njust the right moment to spring?\n\n\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\'t in the best\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\nChristianity can securely keep hold.\n\n       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: "Don\'t think that I have come to\n       bring peace on earth.  I haven\'t come to bring peace,\n       but rather a sword."\n\n\n\n', 'Subject: Fluids vs Liquids\nFrom: mikec@sail.LABS.TEK.COM (Micheal Cranford)\nOrganization: Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton,  OR.\nLines: 18\n\nwest@next02.wam.umd.edu (Brian West) writes:\n[ deleted ]\n>A similar analogy can be made with glass.

In the same way, God too is\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\n\n     Further, belief in God isn\'t a bar to evil.  Let\'s\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\n     in God to justify this belief.

Did I misunderstand?\n\nReading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in\nthe world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a "real"\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\n\nLet\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\nto the Septuagint.\n\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to "fixing"/predating\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\nhave little theological import.\n\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\nmaterial, but so far this hasn\'t happened.\n\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\nOT, unlike for the NT.\n-- \nC.

It would \n          violate the "laws" of physics.  All of the "experts" and \n          "authorities" said so. \n          \n               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  "The \n          demonstration that no possible combination of known \n          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of \n          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man \n          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer \n          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any \n          physical fact to be." \n          \n               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright \n          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final \n          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they \n          crash). \n          \n               Today, orthodox physicists and other "scientists" are \n          saying similar things against several kinds of \'Free Energy\' \n          Technologies, using negative terms such as "pseudo-science" \n          and "perpetual motion", and citing so-called "laws" which \n          assert that "energy cannot be created or destroyed" ("1st law \n          of thermodynamics") and "there is always a decrease in useful \n          energy" ("2nd law of thermodynamics").  The physicists do not \n          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare \n          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF \n          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern "science" and help to \n          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox \n          modern theories. \n          \n               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a \n          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-\n          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT \n          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated \n          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. \n          \n               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, \n          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by \n          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, \n          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they \n          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy \n          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by \n          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced \n          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and \n          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and \n          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are \n          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly \n          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. \n          \n               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, \n          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for \n          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly \n          tapping into energy circulating through the earth\'s magnetic \n          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to \n          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in \n          "Science & Mechanics" magazine, Spring 1980, ("Amazing \n          Magnet-Powered Motor", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, \n          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, \n          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such \n          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible \n          heatpump in one\'s home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.

They typically have a \'SPARK GAP\' in the circuit \n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \n          \'inductance\' and \'capacitance\' of the Device combine to \n          \'RESONATE\' at the same frequency as \'EARTH RESONANCE\' in \n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \'NEUTRAL CENTER\' \n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \n          Tesla Coil, slipping a \'TOROID CHOKE COIL\' around the \n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  ["Earth Energy: \n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems", by John Bigelow, 1976, \n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \n          \n               During the 1930\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named \n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \n          \'IMPLOSION TURBINE\' (German name, \'ZOKWENDLE\'), after \n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book "A \n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources", by Dan A. Davidson, \n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \n          which then converts the pump\'s motor into an ELECTRIC \n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \n          of the earth\'s rotation, via the \'Coriolis effect\', LIKE A \n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \n          \n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \'McClintock \n          Air Motor\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \n          \n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \n          common household smoke detector. \n          \n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \n          reactor which he calls \'Migma\', which uses NON-radioactive \n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \n          "Tokamaks" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \n          for every watt put in.  ["New Times" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \n          pages 32-40.] \n          \n               And then there are the \'cold fusion\' experiments that \n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \n          \n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called "laws" \n          of thermodynamics are NOT so "absolute".  For example, the \n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the \'Reciprocal System\', (which he describes in detail \n          in several books such as "Nothing But Motion" (1979) and "The \n          Universe of Motion" (1984)), in which the physical universe \n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \n          between them, with-OUT the "heat death" predicted by \n          thermodynamic "laws".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \n          seemingly converting "low-quality energy" into "high-quality \n          energy". \n          \n               Also, certain religious organizations such as \'Sant Mat\' \n          and \'Eckankar\' teach their Members that the physical universe \n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \n          channels, as described in books like "The Path of the \n          Masters", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and "Eckankar: The Key \n          to Secret Worlds", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \n          called the \'Astral Plane\'.  Long-time Members of these groups \n          have learned to \'Soul Travel\' into these higher worlds and \n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \n          those described in the book "Psychic Discoveries Behind the \n          Iron Curtain". \n          \n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors \n          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop \n          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional \n          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their \n          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If \n          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of \n          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and \n          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and \n          pollution and its harmful effects (including the \'GREENHOUSE \n          EFFECT\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil \n          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue \n          to increase. \n          \n               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development \n          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize \n          private production (until the producers can make it on their \n          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of \n          Free Energy Hardware. \n          \n               The long-range effects of such government intervention \n          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy \n          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining \n          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, \n          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to \n          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\'s, \n          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that \n          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, \n          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be \n          able to realize the "opportunity costs" of paying electric \n          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would \n          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to \n          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government \n          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be \n          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE \n          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. \n          \n               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of \n          business, but society as a whole, and the earth\'s environment \n          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People, \n          that government should serve, rather than the big \n          corporation$ and bank$. \n          \n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (patents, articles, books). \n\n          \n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \n\n\n                                   Robert E.

But they have been systematically \n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \n\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \n          space and time: \n    \n               (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME." \n    \n               (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN." \n    \n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \n          (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL \n          DATUM"). \n      \n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \n          BURSTS). \n          \n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \n          matter. \n\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \n          complex mathematics, in his books. \n    \n\n\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson\'s Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal "RECIPROCITY". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson\'s lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers\' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\'s books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres", \n          "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\'s Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson\'s organization, "THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super \n          Collider", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don\'t realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\'t we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the "Supercollider"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum". \n     \n               In Larson\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help "prove" Einstein\'s "General Theory of Relativity". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by \n          INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of "Special \n          Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\'s Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book "THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory\'s success: \n          In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\'s \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the "Cosmic Sector".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by "fusion".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\'s internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron \n          stars", "black holes", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode\'s Law. \n          \n\n\n          "Black Hole" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black \n          holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and \n          concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original "black holes". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black \n          holes", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is \n          clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black \n          hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to "prove" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\'s severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him "wiser".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\'s \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\'s book "NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level." \n          \n               Note that in Larson\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate).  \n          ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson\'s Theory.)  [I might have the "above" and \n          "below" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\'s Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

Smith.  The introduction is written by\nPaul Kurtz. \n\n\tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of\n\tthe world\'s fastest growing religions, with as many as\n\t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church\'s\n\taggressive missionary program, covering more than one\n\thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world\n\tcountries.\n\t\n\tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and\n\tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict\n\tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly\n\treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of\n\ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief\n\tand practice, the church is opposed to abortion,\n\tpornography, sexual freedom, women\'s rights, and other, in\n\tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it\n\tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.\n\t\n\tCentered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy\n\tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western\n\tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft\n\tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,\n\tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed\n\tgovernment officials.\n\t\n\tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by\n\tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had\n\tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill\n\tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he\n\thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of\n\tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written "by\n\tthe commandment of God," claims that the ancient Hebrews\n\tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors\n\tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who\n\thave been baptized in the "true church" will be reunited\n\tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can\n\tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the\n\thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been\n\tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and\n\tas heretics by religious fundamentalists.\n\t\n\tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was\n\tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because\n\tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from\n\tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,\n\twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham\n\tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over\n\tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further\n\twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. \n\tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of\n\tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice\n\tin nineteenth-century America.\n\t\n\tWhile other religions go back many centuries --\n\tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,\n\t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are\n\tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon\n\troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this\n\thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny\n\tis dangerous to the faith.\n\t\n\tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles\n\tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong\n\tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical\n\texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of\n\tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion\n\tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a\n\tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the\n\thistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz\n\t\n\nThe article itself is super.\n\n  ,...,.,,\n /666;    \',    \n////;    _~ -   \n(/@/----0-~-0\n ;\'  . `` ~ \\\'\n  , `    \' , >\n;;|\\..((   -C---->> jimtims p00168@psilink.com \n;;| >-  `.__),;;\n\n', 'Subject: Re: Gamma Ray Bursters.

In this time,\nthey don\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\'s) will be in the plane of the\ngalaxy.  \n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\nsuppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\ndisk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\'s an \nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\'t work, also.  As I\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\nthese characteristics.  \n        \n        I think that\'s all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows\nsomething that I don\'t know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of\ntaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\ndistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,\nblack holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.

Matthew\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\n\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\n    from the expression "R-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\n\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\n\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\'s energy for power from its solar\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the\n    geological and biological sense.\n\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\n    that Venus\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\n    that of Earth\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\n    of an ocean.\n\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\n    the concept of Mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\n    launcher autopilot failed.\n\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\n    images of Mars\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\n\n\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\n\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\n\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\n    to do so.\n\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\n    the first radar studies of the planet\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\n    its batteries failed.\n\n\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\n\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\n\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\n\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\n\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\n\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\n\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\n\n\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\n\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\n\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\n\n\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\n\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\' sky was\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\n\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\n    engineers\' efforts through May of 1983.\n\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\'s lander has been designated the\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\n\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\n    down on April 12, 1980.\n\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\n\n\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\n\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\n\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\n    is known). Titan\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\' appearance was\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\n\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\n\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\n    discovered. Neptune\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\'s liquid at 38K?)\n\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\n    location of the heliopause.\n\n\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\n\n\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\n\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\n\t     craft in solar orbit.\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\n\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\n\t     from surface.\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8\n\t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were\n\t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.\n    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil\n\t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\n\t      1972.\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\'s\n\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\n\t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\n\t      1976.\n\n\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\n\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\n\t       lost enroute in 1961.\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\n\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\n\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\n\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\n\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\n\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\n\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\n\t       similar in 1969.\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\n\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\n\t       1972.\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\n\t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar\n\t       mission.\n    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.\n\t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.\n    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of\n\t\tplanet\'s surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.\n    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian\n\t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on\n\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\n\t     March of 1986.\n\n\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\n\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\n\t     enroute the following year.\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\n\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\n\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\n\t     Planet in 1971.\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\n\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\n\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\n\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\n\t     probe MARINER 9.\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\n\t     with its flyby bus.\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\' largest\n\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\n\t       human/computer error.\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\n\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\n\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\n\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\n    space program remains to be seen.\n\n\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\'s Comet within about 7 million km\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\'s. The closest\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\n\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\'s radius)), and the third\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\n\n\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\n\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\n    19, but the spacecraft\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\n\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\'s atmosphere. Hiten\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\n    approach:\n\n\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\n\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\n\tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\n\tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days\n\n\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\n\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\n    public and university library.

Good university libraries will carry\n    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission\n    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study\n    some of the books listed above.\n\n    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL\n    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth\'s\n    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,\n    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER\n    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the\n    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions\n    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and\n    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\n    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\n    probably know.\n\n    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\n    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their\n    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe\n    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,\n    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.\n\n    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I\n    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas\n    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from\n    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.\n\n    Larry Klaes  klaes@verga.enet.dec.com\n\nNEXT: FAQ #11/15 - Upcoming planetary probes - missions and schedules\n', "From: bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (Bill Conner)\nSubject: Re: free moral agency\nNntp-Posting-Host: okcforum.osrhe.edu\nOrganization: Okcforum Unix Users Group\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\nDistribution: na\nLines: 30\n\nMaddi Hausmann (madhaus@netcom.com) wrote:\n\n: But how do we know that you're representing the REAL Christians?\n: ;-)\n\n: Bill, you're an asshole.

In other words, if you made\na bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what\nyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in\nall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into\nthe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The\nfoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,\nso there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major\nimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the\nprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n", 'From: mangoe@cs.umd.edu (Charley Wingate)\nSubject: Re: Origins of the bible.\nOrganization: U of Maryland, Dept. of Computer Science, Coll.

Bussard, Journal of\n\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n\t    thrust-power "gain" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, "high-thrust"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    "high-thrust" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth/moon space.\n\n\t"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size.

Considering \nthe confusing spitting contest over \'rights\', (there are TOO \ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \nof my site.    (I ain\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \n\n\n\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \n\n\nI\'d like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly \npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n\n\n(P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, \njust a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know \nthat other people may not accept it without a complaint.)  \n', 'From: clarke@acme.ucf.edu (Thomas Clarke)\nSubject: Re: pushing the envelope\nOrganization: University of Central Florida\nDistribution: na\nLines: 18\n\n> In <1993Apr3.233154.7045@Princeton.EDU> lije@cognito.Princeton.EDU (Elijah  \nMillgram) writes:\n> \n> \n> A friend of mine and I were wondering where the expression "pushing\n> the envelope" comes from.

How do I become an astronaut?\n\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\'s probably\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\'re better off hoping to\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle "mission\n    specialist".\n\n    If you aren\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can\'t, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\'s image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first".\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn\'t make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations.

When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\n    specified tour of duty.\n\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\n\n    Pay and Benefits\n    ----------------\n\n    Civilians\n\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\n    and experience.\n\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\n\n    Military\n\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\n    other similar military matters.\n\n\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\n', 'From: jcopelan@nyx.cs.du.edu (The One and Only)\nSubject: Re: Amusing atheists and agnostics\nOrganization: Nyx, Public Access Unix at U. of Denver Math/CS dept.\nLines: 24\n\nIn article <1qsum1INNg5k@shelley.u.washington.edu> jimh@carson.u.washington.edu (James Hogan) writes:\n>\n>I think you\'ve missed the point.

Do you mean by "omnipotent"\nthat God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates\na self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively\nuseless.\n\nTo be descriptive, omnipotence must mean "being all-powerful" and\nnot "being able to do anything/everything".\n\nLet me illustrate by analogy.\nSuppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose\nfurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by any\nnation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country\nat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the\nUS see fit.  The US would be militarily "omnipotent".\n\nBut suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not\ninterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current\ncivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.\n\nTechnically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to \nunilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \nof non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to\nstrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would\never be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it\ncould actually do, although it had the power to do "whatever it wanted".\nThe US would simply "never want to interfere" for such an idea would\nbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate\nnon-interference policy.\n\nGod is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but\nHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what\nHe, Himself is.\n\nI hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning\nomnipotence.\n\nRegards,\n\nJim B.\n', "From: nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu\nSubject: 30826\nArticle-I.D.: aurora.1993Apr25.151108.1\nOrganization: University of Alaska Fairbanks\nLines: 14\nNntp-Posting-Host: acad3.alaska.edu\n\nI like option C of the new space station design.. \nIt needs some work, but it is simple and elegant..\n\nIts about time someone got into simple construction versus overly complex...\n\nBasically just strap some rockets and a nose cone on the habitat and go for\nit..\n\nMight be an idea for a Moon/Mars base to.. \n\nWhere is Captain Eugenia(sp) when you need it (reference to russian heavy\nlifter, I think).\n==\nMichael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I'm not high, just jacked\n", 'Organization: Penn State University\nFrom: <SMM125@psuvm.psu.edu>\nSubject: Re: YOU WILL ALL GO TO HELL!!!\nLines: 1\n\njsn104 is jeremy scott noonan\n', "From: David.Anderman@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Update - Back to the Moon bill\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 51\n\n          Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:\n                          The Next Step\n                          \n        The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase \nAct is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  many\ncongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,\nfor a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best\npossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his\nposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,\nCongressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long\nrecord of support and interest in space development, and helped\npass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements\nAct.                      \n        There is a small group of activists in southern California \nwho have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.\nWe are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown\nabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space\nconstituents to let him know that they care about getting\nAmerica back to the Moon.\n        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert \nfor space activists to call or write George Brown to have him\nintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late\nspring, 1993.\n        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's\noffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.\n        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support\nthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\nby necessity, must choose.                    \n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\nof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\n\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\nspiritual explanations. \n\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn\'t: it is self-\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \n\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\n\n There is no need\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\n: determnined.\n\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\nwill or not? \n\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\n: acquire intelligence, it\'s just a happy accident.\n\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\nsurvive, those which don\'t don\'t make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\n\n: For an atheist, no\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\n: an event can have value. \n\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \n\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\nfor starters.\n\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\n: establish your values.\n\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\nseverely flawed.\n\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\'s\nown people.\n\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\nof other nations. \n\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\n\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\'t like it\n: - that\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\n: no weight in any "absolute" sense.\n\nIt looks like you haven\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\nof some physical event), and other\'s happiness, too, if the observer\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\nmeaning. \n\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\ndo not exist. \n\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others\'\nexistence.\n\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \n\n: That you don\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n: or God\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\'ve been\n: conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\n\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\n\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\ncease to be subjective. \n\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \ninherently subjective. \n\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\nwe don\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\'s\nown and then to get mad at this. \n\nGod must be schizophrenic.\n\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n: weight whatsoever.\n\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\n\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\n_including_ gods.

Using power obtained in this way for propulsion\nis useful only in special situations, however.\n\nWhat you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,\nand run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy\n*into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.\n\nIf you want more information, trying looking up "electrodynamic propulsion",\n"tether applications", and "magsails".\n\n>Can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the\n>electrical field?\n\nNo.  A "dragless" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel\nconstantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if*\nthere was no drag.

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.

It\'s a command to the spacecraft that tells\nit "If you don\'t hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong\nwith your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode\nin an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth."\n\nThe spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other.\nEarth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine,\nthere\'s no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft\'s\npoint of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything is\nfine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how long\nshould the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and\nbegins to take corrective action?  That "how long" is the command loss timer.\nDuring relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be set\nto rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo "expect to\nhear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours".\n', ' sgiblab!adagio.panasonic.com!nntp-server.caltech.edu!keith\nSubject: Re: <Political Atheists?\nFrom: keith@cco.caltech.edu (Keith Allan Schneider)\n <1p6rgcINNhfb@gap.caltech.edu> <1p88fi$4vv@fido.asd.sgi.com> \n <1p9bseINNi6o@gap.caltech.edu> <1pamva$b6j@fido.asd.sgi.com> <1pcq4pINNqp1@gap.caltech.edu> <30071@ursa.bear.com>\nOrganization: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena\nNNTP-Posting-Host: punisher.caltech.edu\nLines: 22\n\nhalat@pooh.bears (Jim Halat) writes:\n\n>>I think an objective morality does exist, but that most flavors of morality\n>>are only approximations to it.

The\nspace environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to\ntemperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation\neffects on materials), so your "fabric" may not retain any flexibility\nfor long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure\nchanges in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could\nlead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.\n\nThese are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal\nfor an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of\nsuccess.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     "Good ideas are common -- what\'s uncommon are people who\'ll\n      work hard enough to bring them about." -- Ashleigh Brilliant\n', "From: prb@access.digex.net (Pat)\nSubject: Re: Teflon (Re: Long term Human Missions\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications USA\nLines: 18\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\nIn article <1rtghr$j9v@techbook.techbook.com> dant@techbook.techbook.com (Dan Tilque) writes:\n>\n|The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say\n|the linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm.

Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\'s\n     qualified for STS and ELV\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption "B" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options "A" and "B".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.\n\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\ncylinder that\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\n  - 7 berthing ports\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\n  - increased crew time for utilization\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\n', 'From: baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (Ron Baalke)\nSubject: Successful Balloon Flight Measures Ozone Layer\nOrganization: Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nLines: 96\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\nKeywords: JPL\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \n\nForwarded from:\nPUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE\nJET PROPULSION LABORATORY\nCALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION\nPASADENA, CALIF. 91109. (818) 354-5011\n\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\n#1506\n\n     Scientists at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth\'s ozone layer.\n\n     The April 3 flight from California\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \n\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\nDiscovery.\n\n     "We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\nimportant ways," said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\nthe balloon research campaign.  \n\n     "There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite," he\ncontinued.  "The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\nright."\n\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\n\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \n\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\nto separate from the balloon.\n\n     "We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\nmeasurements," Margitan explained, "and we also needed to fly in\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear."\n\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\nscientists.    \n\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\ncontract from NASA\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\n\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\n\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\'s Upper\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\nProgram.                        \n\n                              #####\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps \n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation \n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation\n                                                  | instead.\n', 'From: mayne@pipe.cs.fsu.edu (William Mayne)\nSubject: Re: [soc.motss, et al.] "Princeton axes matching funds for Boy Scouts"\nOrganization: Florida State University Computer Science Department\nReply-To: mayne@cs.fsu.edu\nLines: 21\n\nIn article <JVIGNEAU.93Apr5182106@cs.ulowell.edu> jvigneau@cs.ulowell.edu (Joe Vigneau) writes:\n>\n>If anything, the BSA has taught me, I don\'t know, tolerance or something.\n>Before I met this guy, I thought all gays were \'faries\'.

It uses freon jets for\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\n\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I\'m speaking\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\n\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \nquantity.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\n\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\n\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\n\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\nindex is near the optimal level.\n\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\n\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10.

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\n\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC\n\n1.

Massive amounts of regolith would\nhave to be processed.\n\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo\'s claims some time ago about the moon\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn\'t\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth\'s crust,\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\n\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; "high-Ti" basalts (Apollo 11\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\nbasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\nmined today).\n\n\tPaul F.

WHere are they.\nOriginator: news@nimaster\nNntp-Posting-Host: astro.princeton.edu\nOrganization: Princeton University\nLines: 51\n\n\nI feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\nBATSE press releases.\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \n     "if you smack two neutron\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\n      be wrong."\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\nburst, but the \'fireball\' of energy and matter that is created\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \nso-called \'failed supernovae\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\nin the failed supernova scenario.\n\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\nit *must* be so-and-so.\n\nRalph Wijers\n\n', "From: loss@fs7.ECE.CMU.EDU (Doug Loss)\nSubject: Re: Crazy? or just Imaginitive?\nOrganization: Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon\nLines: 22\n\nIn article <1993Apr21.205403.1@aurora.alaska.edu> nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu writes:\n>\n>Unfortunately H.

There is no planet inside of\nthe orbit of Mercury.\n\nThe idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury\'s observed\nperihelion precession and the value it should have had according to\nNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier\'s system\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\nafoot with Mercury.\n\nBut alas, \'twere not so.  Mercury\'s perihelion precesses at the rate\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\ncurved due to the sun\'s mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\nand Albert Einstein\'s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \ngeometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of\nit\'s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession\nof Mercury\'s perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb\'s\nnumbers rather than Leverrier\'s.)\n\nOf course not everybody believes Einstein, and that\'s fine.  But subsequent\nefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar\nhave been fruitless.\n\n-Bill Gawne\n\n "Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe\n  are the laws of the universe."                       - G.

In fact, be-\nfore BATSE, having this widely separated "Interplanetary Network" was the\nonly sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot\nlocate a burst (except to say "It\'s somewhere in the field of view.").  With\ntwo detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector\nto narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.

It is a non sequitur.\n\nLook, any approach to the Qur\'an must be done with intelligence and\nthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the\nQuran\'s message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly\nanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings\nit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals\nof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that\nsince women can clearly be "forgiven" and "rewarded" they _must_ have\nsouls (from the above verse).\n\nLet\'s try to understand what the Qur\'an is trying to teach, rather than\ntry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this\npassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur\'an based on\nignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations \nfully consistent are more limited.  Let\'s try to discuss these\ninterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can\nignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try\nto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but\nprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\n\n Fred Rice\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n', 'From: globus@nas.nasa.gov (Al Globus)\nSubject: Space Colony Size Preferences Summary\nOrganization: Applied Research Office, NASA Ames Research Center\nReply-To: globus@nas.nasa.gov\nDistribution: sci.space\nLines: 92\n\n\nSome time ago I sent the following message:\n   Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony.

If I forgot or botched your\nfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\'s an acronym *not*\non this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure\nit out, I\'ll add it to the list.\n\nNote that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*\nacronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated\nevery acronym I ever saw, I\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)\n\nThe list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All\ncomments regarding it are welcome; I\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.\n\nNote that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\'re on your\nown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of\nacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that\nare essentially always explained as they\'re introduced are omitted.\nFurther, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of\nthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\'re simply\ndifferent ways of referring to the same thing.\n\nThanks to everybody who\'s sent suggestions since the first version of\nthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),\nwho is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in\ncharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),\nwho is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and\nterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).\n\nSpecial thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA\nReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and\nAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly\nmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.\n\nSpecial Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program\nwritten by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the\nacronym list in an entertaining fashion.

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \n    for the planet Venus. \n\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \n\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\'\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \n\n        The Soviet probes\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\n    VENERAs\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\n\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\' \n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\n\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \n    across, due to Venus\' very dense atmosphere.\n\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\' \n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern "continent" of Ishtar Terra.  \n\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \n    probes maintained that distinction.\n\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\'s\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\n\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\n    gas to perform the operation.  \n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\n\n        Venus by Balloon\n\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\'s mantle of \n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \n    the French space agency Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\n\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\n\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \n\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \n\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \n    encounter.\n\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\n    Japan\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \n    comet, while Japan\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \n\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\n\n        The Soviets\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \n    location of the comet\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\n\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\n    successfully arrived. \n\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\n    permeated the planet\'s atmosphere. \n\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \n    had thought the planet\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\n\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\n    journey.  The layer\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \n\n        Early in the first balloon\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \n    miles) above the surface. \n\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\'s \n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\n\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\n    returned during the lander\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\n\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\'s results\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \n    over the last seven years.\n\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\n    bodies with one space vessel.\n\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the "continent" of Aphrodite \n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \n    miles) towards the surface.\n\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \n    through the balloon\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\'s nephelometer \n    failed to function.\n\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\n    Terra\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\'s resting place was smoother\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\n\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \n    hours.\n\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\n\n        Future Plans Diverted\n\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\n    the early 1990s.\n\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\'s \n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \n    the VEGA balloons\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\n\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\n    Mars\' largest moon, Phobos. \n\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\n\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\n    landing in March of 1989. \n\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \n\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \n    to "open up" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a "free market".\n\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \n    make money.  \n\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\n\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \n\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\n\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \n    probe\'s primary target\'s major moons in 1610.\n\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\'s first planetary\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\n    planet\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\n    that violent atmosphere.\n\n        On the Drawing Boards\n\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\n\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\n    to study Venus\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\n\n        Humans on Venus      \n\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\n    Earth\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \n    to speed up the planet\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\n    if not millennia.\n\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\n\n        Bibliography -\n\n         Barsukov, V.

We have to look for\nimplausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of\nmodels.\n\nA paper on the possibility of GRB\'s in the Oort cloud just came\nthrough the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this\npaper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject\nline \n  get 9304001\n\n\nHere is the abstract of that paper.\n\n   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \\GRBs puts them\n   at cosmological distances;\n   but as long as there is no distance\n   indicator to these events all possible sources which are\n   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is\n   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,\n   although there is no known mechanism for generating \\GRBs\n   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\GRBs\n   originate in the solar cometary cloud\n   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\n\n   We use the available data on the distribution of \\GRBs (the BATSE\n   catalogue up to March, 1992), and\n   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to\n   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations\n   between the angular distributions of \\GRBs and comets\' aphelia,\n   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,\n   at least to some extent, true variations\n   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\\vov$\n   test to both distributions.\n\n   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a\n   $\\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D\n   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for\n   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.\n   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but\n   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any\n   connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations\n   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\sim 800$\n   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\n   Currently,\n    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement\n   found for the $\\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort\n   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \\GRBs.\n', 'From: rls@uihepa.hep.uiuc.edu (Ray Swartz (Oh, that guy again))\nSubject: Re: japanese moon landing?\nReply-To: rls@uihepa.hep.uiuc.edu\nOrganization: Vis-Orb Tragnetics Recorporation\nLines: 35\n\nIn article <C5L2xt.IqD@zoo.toronto.edu>, henry@zoo.toronto.edu (Henry Spencer) writes:\n>In article <C5Kys1.C6r@panix.com> dannyb@panix.com (Daniel Burstein) writes:\n>>A short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention\n>>about how the Japanese, using what sounded like a gravity assist, had just\n>>managed to crash (or crash-land) a package on the moon.\n>\n>Their Hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric\n>Earth orbit doing lunar flybys, and then was inserted into lunar orbit\n>using some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering.

For\ninstance, \'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering\' might be thought of as a\nplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the\ncontention remains true, just as \'5 + 7 = 12\' remains correct even if\nthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\ncontent;  \'One ought always to do the right thing\' is plainly true in\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\ntalk of \'self-evident truths\', but can he deny the subjectivist\'s claim\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion\nis, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have\npreferences regarding human activity."\n \nDavid Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

As we are all different, we quite obviously require \ndifferent levels of evidence.\n\n\tAs one pointed out, one\'s history is important.

The \nonly time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the \nindividual always wear business suits, etc.\n\n\tThe degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the \nclaim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the \nlevel of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the \nconsequences of the proposition are.\n\n\n\n\tIf the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain \nwhy one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between \ntwo charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their \ndistance apart. \n\n\tRemember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then\nwe can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the \nconsequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of \naffairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law, \nthey are irrelevent when theorizing about the "Truth" of the law.\n\n\tGiven that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including \nthe consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of \naffiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find\n"The Truth"?\n\n\n\n\tBy the way, what is "Truth"? Please define before inserting it in \nthe conversation. Please explain what "Truth" or "TRUTH" is. I do think that \nanything is ever known for certain.

The article starts with "A leader\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\nbe impossible." O\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\nmeaningful research "is a real question for me."\nO\'Connor said "everything is fair game," including\n"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\nmanned space shuttle fleet."\n\nO\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\ninto three categories based on cost.\n\nThe Post says O\'Connor described the design derived\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\nlistened in on part of O\'Connor\'s briefing to the press\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\'Connor\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\nCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\'Connor say\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\nthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).\n\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\nas "one features modules that could gradually be fitted\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."\n\nThe last sentence in the article contradicts the title\n& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He\n[O\'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned\nspace station Freedom is still possible within the\nadministration\'s budget guidelines."\n\n', 'From: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\'Dwyer)\nSubject: Re: Bayesian Statistics, theism and atheism\nOrganization: Siemens-Nixdorf AG\nLines: 192\nNNTP-Posting-Host: d012s658.ap.mchp.sni.de\n\nIn article <1993Apr24.165301.8321@dcs.warwick.ac.uk> simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk (Simon Clippingdale) writes:\n#In article <1quei1$8mb@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\'Dwyer) writes:\n#>In article <1993Apr15.181924.21026@dcs.warwick.ac.uk> simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk (Simon Clippingdale) writes:\n[I write:]\n#>>> Imagine that 1000000 Alterian dollars turn up in your bank account every\n#>>> month.

When you say (paraphrased)\n#in (2) that this is not "evidence for [benefactor]", for example, what you\n#mean is that it\'s no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].\n\nYes, that\'s what I mean.\n\n#In (3), however, you\'ve shifted the meaning of "evidence for [benefactor]"\n#so that it now means `absolute\' "evidence for [benefactor]" rather than\n#`relative\' "evidence for [benefactor]" w.r.t. [bug].\n\nNot really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I\nthink this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,\nin my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates\nto theism making predictions (prayer, your \'Rapture\' example), I don\'t\nbuy your use of Occam\'s razor in all cases where A=0.\n\nIn my example, one couldn\'t dismiss\n[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary\nto explain the dosh.  I brought up the \'one-by-one dismissal\' process to\nshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you\'re saying in this\npost, it seems you agree, and we\'re talking at cross-purposes.\n\n#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).\n#\n#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:\n#\n#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1\n#\n#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it\'s either the benefactor *or* a bug\n#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then\n#\n#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)\n#\n#so\n#\n#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1\n#\n#but (3) implies that\n#\n#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.\n\nNo, this isn\'t what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\nnecessarily no new observation (we\'ve already seen the dosh) to change\nthose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that\nit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that\'s\nprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are\none class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of\nhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise \nwould _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or\nretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   \nAlternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds\nthat the answer can\'t be known, or that the notional probability estimates\nare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).\n\n#> As they do when the set M is filled by "the universe is caused by x",\n#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation\n#> tends to one conclusion over the other.\n#\n#Exactly the point I was making, I think.

See my post on the other branch of this\n#thread.\n\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.

When I say that something is\n#"evidence against" an hypothesis, that doesn\'t imply that observation of\n#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the\n#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it\'s still\n#evidence against H.\n\nNo, I got that.  I\'m talking about the case when A=0.  You\'re clearly\ncorrect when A!=0.   And I\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\'s\ncertainly possible that I\'ve misunderstood what you\'re saying).  However,\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don\'t exist, or are unnecessary\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\na fallacy upon close examination.

To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour\n> against Rushdie?\n\nOnce the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on\nthe matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes\nshowing\nthe dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so\nnewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there\nwould\nappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how\ndramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the\nsituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued\nthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central\nspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman\'s\nright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it\'s\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\n\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \nwas annoying.)\n\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\n"organized"\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a "secular" Islam - an Islam\nseparated from it\'s Qur\'an, it\'s Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\nmade\nhis views known - the Muslim\'s made their anger at his book known. The\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\ntime,\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\nindividuals.\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\nengaged\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\n\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\n\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\nkind, has no\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in "boldly"\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\na kind of secular "heroic Knight",mounted on the his media steed,\n doing battle with the "dragon" of Islamic "fundamentalism".\n\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim\'s hold dear, \nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\nwho, when\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie\'s continued media mischief\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\n\n>You\'re attempts at justification are not doing the\n> image of Islam any good.\n\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. "Image" is\nthe chief concern of Muslim \'apologists\' for Islam and for Rushdie.\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\nwould then be thought to have a good "image" (Principally because it would\nby and large reflect the secular image). A "good image" usually means " be\nmore\nlike me".\n\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\nthat\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.\n\n>  In Iran, the situation was monitored for many\n> >months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free\n> >worldwide voice that the media gave him, the situation was monitored\n> >more seriously.

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n", 'From: hyder@cs.utexas.edu (Syed Irfan Hyder)\nSubject: Re: The Qur\'an and atheists (was Re: Jewish Settlers Demolish a Mosque in Gaza)\nOrganization: CS Dept, University of Texas at Austin\nLines: 20\nNNTP-Posting-Host: pageboy.cs.utexas.edu\n\nIn article <2944846190.2.p00261@psilink.com> "Robert Knowles" <p00261@psilink.com> writes:\n::DATE:   Sun, 25 Apr 1993 10:13:30 GMT\n::FROM:   Fred Rice <darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au:\n::\n::\n::The Qur\'an talks about those who take their lusts and worldly desires for \n::their "god".\n::\n::I think this probably encompasses most atheists.\n::\n:: Fred Rice\n:: darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n:\n:As well as all the Muslim men screwing fourteen year old prostitutes in\n:Thailand.

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n", 'From: higgins@fnalf.fnal.gov (Bill Higgins-- Beam Jockey)\nSubject: Which Gehrels?

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,\nyou need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific\nimpulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry\nweight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.\nA small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or\nbirdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be\nthe payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within\nthe capability of the amateur rocketry community.\n\nIt sounds like a good Science Fair project--\'Reduction\nof Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics\'.\nOr, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed\nhere: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year\non the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of\nan orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000\nfor the first person to bring it down, and I am sure\nthere are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,\nor just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.\n\nOf course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.\n(Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use\nof a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied\nto Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)\n-- \n\t\tDavid M.

The system is specifically designed for\n    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current\n    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and\n    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom\n    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a\n    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA\n    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it\n    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments\n    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered\n    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by\n    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during\n    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop\n    between the user and NASA.\n\n    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs\n    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images\n    from NASA\'s planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.\n\n    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8\n    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov\n    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you\'re on the\n    Internet.

The latter was written with\n    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind\n    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).\n\n    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John\n    Snyder\'s USGS publication "Map Projections--A Working Manual", USGS\n    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32\n    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both\n    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It\'s a\n    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one\'s $20.\n\n    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,\n    "An Album of Map Projections", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This\n    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are\n    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.\n\n    You can order these 2 ways.

Back\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

It is evident that the West, especially America,\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\'s\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\nstrong response from the West was required.\n\n> \n>> Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\n>> You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\n>> feel sure that was not your intent.\n> \n> What\'s your intent?

Or to allow them to continue with mass\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I\'d have to\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most "loving" thing to do for the\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\n> \n>> So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?

It is precisely the lessons the world learned\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\n\n> \n>>                                                           I guess we\n>> shouldn\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\n>> German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.\n> \n> Yes, do.

But then\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it\'s evident that \nthe first jury decided that the officers were "not guilty".  Note, \nnot "not guilty" of doing wrong, but "not guilty" of aggravated assault \nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\n\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\n\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\n\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\n\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\nmini-sequence.\n\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\n\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC\n\n1.

As far as commercialization, that is\n>a long ways off.  ...\n> Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this\n>threaten further work on DC-? ?\n  \n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: "Comparison of Propulsion\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\n0639)." by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\'s a high-speed\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\n   The design (the concept is also called "Beta") as laid out in the\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\npayload on an expendable second stage.\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\'s\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\'t carry the hard-to-handle\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude "In conjunction with its major\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\nbe shown to be operationally viable."\n  \n>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\nstudies trying straighten out the government\'s future space\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the "4-2-3"\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\nfor future US gov\'t space transportation systems, and trying to\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\nthe investment and risk of going to "leap frog" new technologies\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\n   It\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\'t\nthat there aren\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\nthe near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a\nfinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor\n  \n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n', 'From: cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb)\nSubject: Re: Societally acceptable behavior\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 20\n\nI guess I\'m delving into a religious language area.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.\n\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\n', 'From: swf@elsegundoca.ncr.com (Stan Friesen)\nSubject: Re: After 2000 years, can we say that Christian Morality is\nOrganization: NCR Teradata Database Business Unit\nLines: 74\n\n[This is SWF in another indirect post via Dan].\n\nIn article <1993Apr20.150829.27925@asl.dl.nec.com>,\nduffy@aslss02.asl.dl.nec.com (Joseph Duffy) writes:\n|> In article <1993Apr17.184948.4847@microsoft.com>\nrusspj@microsoft.com (Russ Paul-Jones) writes:\n|> >\n|> >The same way that any theory is proven false.

First, you are discussing only\nexperimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The\nmain criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make\nprediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be\nthe result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity\noccuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of\nthe lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the\nobservations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science -\nit is\n*not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted\nsense.\n\nSecondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just\nthe\nrequirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.\nThe\nobservation of a fossil is \'repeatable\', since any qualified observer\nmay\nlook at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also,\nthere is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will\ncorrespond\nto the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is\ntested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some\nconclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.\n\nUnfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been\nperipheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the\nfront legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,\nrather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).\n\nSo, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the\nnecessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the\noriginal\nevent does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.\n\n[This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-\nterrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determination\nof the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].\n\n--\nsarima@teradata.com                     (formerly tdatirv!sarima)\n  or\nStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com\n\nsarima@teradata.com\t\t\t(formerly tdatirv!sarima)\n  or\nStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com\n\n', 'From: mccullou@snake2.cs.wisc.edu (Mark McCullough)\nSubject: Re: Death Penalty / Gulf War (long)\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin, Madison -- Computer Sciences Dept.\nLines: 75\n\nIn article <37501@optima.cs.arizona.edu> sham@cs.arizona.edu (Shamim Zvonko Mohamed) writes:\n>This is the most unmitigated bilge I\'ve seen in a while.

I don\'t see a realistic  prospect for\nbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If\nthe DC flops, it\'ll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and\nthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a\nprospect too depressing to bear.\n\n(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\ndirection.

It\'s creating its own market for\nsmall payloads.)\n\nI read the magazines and I\'ve attended the last two IAFs.

Offhand:\n\nGriffin is no longer an "office" head, so that\'s bad.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\nRegress seemed to think: we can\'t fund anything by Griffin, because\nthat would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the\n$ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a\nmission to Mars that would cost 400 billion. Therefore there will be\nno Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...\n\nThey were killing Griffin\'s main program simply because some sycophants\nsomewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into\nthe same old stuff. Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he\'s\na communist hardliner.\n\nAt least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward\nwon\'t be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded\nghetto. That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very\ngood. And if he brings something up, noone can say "why don\'t you go\nback to the OSE where you belong" (and where he couldn\'t even get money\nfor design studies).\n--\nPhil Fraering         |"Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff.\npgf@srl02.cacs.usl.edu|Like how the ancient Mayans had televison."

This\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\n\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\n       examples.\n\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\n\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\n\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\nworld\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\n\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\nof the world\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\norganisation.\n\n\n\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\nEUTELSAT.\n\nOLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,\nwhen the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the\nend of its design life.\n\n       \n', 'From: madison@wam.umd.edu (Rob Shearman Jr.)\nSubject: Re: Long term Human Missions\nNntp-Posting-Host: rac3.wam.umd.edu\nOrganization: University of Maryland, College Park\nLines: 15\n\n\nExcerpt From: rek@siss81 (Robert Kaye)\n\n:Just a few contributions from the space program to "regular" society:\n:\n:1.\tCalculators\n:2.\tTeflon (So your eggs don\'t stick in the pan)\n:3.\tPacemakers (Kept my grandfather alive from 1976 until 1988)\n\n                    Don\'t forget Tang!  ::smile::\n\n -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n    Robert M.

Whilst I\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\n\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\n\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\nmay not.\n\n"What is atheism?"\n\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\noften referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong\natheism".\n\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak\natheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong\natheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".\n\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\nflat-out denials.\n\n"But isn\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\'t exist?"\n\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n\n"What is agnosticism then?"\n\nThe term \'agnosticism\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\ndisclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\nsure whether God exists.\n\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\nyou can work out someone\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\nuse agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only when\nreferring to "strong atheism".\n\nBeware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, it\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\nsure is that atheists don\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\'t\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\nabout the universe.\n\n"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"\n\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\'s best to ask her.\n\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\nsee no evidence that God exists.\n\n"But isn\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"\n\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\n\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\nmight be found, to show that it isn\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\'t exist.\n\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\nthe time; they don\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\'t conclusively\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\nprove that he doesn\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\nby any present-day religion exists.\n\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\nGod are not really applicable.\n\n"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"\n\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\ndetectable.\n\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\nimportance whether he exists or not.\n\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\n\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\nfrom all the other things that don\'t exist?\n\n"OK, you may think there\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n isn\'t it still a religious belief?"\n\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "the\nredefinition game".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\nthat it can\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", but\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn\'t\natheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\nworship.\n\n[ It\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n  "religion" according to such a definition. ]\n\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such as\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\n\n"OK, so it\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?"\n\nFirstly, it\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\nactually believes in.\n\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\nreligious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not a\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\n\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\'t really match, as\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n\n"If atheism is not religious, surely it\'s anti-religious?"\n\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or\n"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\nit can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believers\nspeak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheists\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n\nMost atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" in\nmany countries.\n\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" others\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\nworship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about when\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\n\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\nchurch and state should remain separate.\n\n"But if you don\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n surely that\'s the same as state atheism?"\n\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\nnature.\n\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\n\n"What about prayer in schools? If there\'s no God, why do you care if people\n pray?"\n\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\nthat those who don\'t pray can\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\n\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\nmotives.\n\n"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n atheists?  Why aren\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\'t\n atheists object to the religious charities?"\n\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\n\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\'t worth shouting about in\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\nof religious beliefs.\n\nTo "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is a\nrather strange idea; it\'s rather like holding a party to say "Today is not my\nbirthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n\n"You said atheism isn\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n one\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?"\n\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\n\nIt\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\nexpectations of others.\n\nOn the whole, we can\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\n\n"How do atheists differ from religious people?"\n\nThey don\'t believe in God.  That\'s all there is to it.\n\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\n\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\nappearance.\n\n"Unexceptional? But aren\'t atheists less moral than religious people?"\n\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\natheists are less moral as they don\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable\n("wrong") behaviour within society.\n\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\natheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposes\nof self-preservation.\n\nMany atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because they\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\nwhat happens to others?  They don\'t know, they simply are that way.\n\nNaturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to use\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\nbehave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\nactions.  For example:\n\n  "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\n   be honor and glory forever and ever."\n\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\n\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\n   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\n   before salvation; 5% after.\n                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]\n\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\nbehaviour.\n\n"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"\n\nIf you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then the\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\n\nIf you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answer\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \'ought\' to work, rather\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\n\n"Then aren\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?"\n\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\nwith what they observed around them.\n\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\n\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\nindividual\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\nchoice that person can honestly make.\n\n"But don\'t atheists want to believe in God?"\n\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\n"Big Brother" figure might be.\n\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\n\n"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\n unwilling in their souls to see!"\n\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\n\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\nComments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren\'t looking properly"\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\n\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\nfutile.\n\n"Isn\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"\n\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\n\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in random\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thing\nthat has a "meaning".\n\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is the\nmeaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup of\ncoffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\n\n"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"\n\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\n\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\n\nIn the end, it\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\'s just\nhard luck.\n\n"Don\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"\n\nThe short answer is "No, do you?"\n\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\n\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\'t resulted in any good proof of\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\n\n"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\'t the same arguments\n apply?"\n\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\nthe sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\n\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\nbut to everyone else.\n\n"What sort of harm?"\n\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\'s not\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\n\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\nof ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\n\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\'s opposition to birth control -- and\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\n\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\nreligion.\n\n"Those weren\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\n sort of excuse."\n\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\'s hard\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\'s a REAL\nChristian and who isn\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\'t decide amongst themselves?\n\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\'t be\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\'t he have\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\naren\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\n\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\nChristian.\n\n"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."\n\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\ndon\'t exist, but that doesn\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\n\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheists\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\n\n"Well, if atheism\'s so great, why are there so many theists?"\n\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"\nit is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\n\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\n\nOf course, there\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\npurposes as well.\n\n"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\n something?"\n\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\'s\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\n\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\'s\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\n\n"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\n that God exists?"\n\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\n\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\n\n"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\n nothing?"\n\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\n\nThe theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\nother memes.\n\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\n\n"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"\n\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\nfew of them; don\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\nreligions.\n\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\n\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\n\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\'s up to you to\n   find it.\n\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n   Make the most of your life, as it\'s probably the only one you\'ll have.\n\n   It\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\n   yourself.\n\n   Just because something\'s popular doesn\'t mean it\'s good.\n\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\'s easy to test.\n\n   Don\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\n\nand finally (and most importantly):\n\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\n\n\nmathew\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\n=q2V5\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nFor information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.\nÿ\n', "From: nether@bigwpi.WPI.EDU (Joel C Belog)\nSubject: Space Shuttle information wanted\nOrganization: Worcester Polytechnic Institute\nLines: 15\nNNTP-Posting-Host: bigwpi.wpi.edu\n\n\n\nHello everyone,\n\n\tI was hoping someone could help me out.

The shock wave from the explosions would transfer\nmomentum to the ship.\n\n  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion\nheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave\ninto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are\ngoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,\nhelium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic\nradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission\nproducts).\n\n  Would this work?  I can\'t see the EM radiation impelling very much\nmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems\nto me you\'re going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs\nout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once\nthey\'re there.\n\n  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?\n\n  Thanks.\n\n-- \n\t--Jim\n\n---\nJim Goltz                    AlterNet Engineer               goltz@uunet.uu.net\n', 'From: livesey@solntze.wpd.sgi.com (Jon Livesey)\nSubject: Re: An Anecdote about Islam\nOrganization: sgi\nLines: 15\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: solntze.wpd.sgi.com\n\nIn article <114127@bu.edu>, jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger) writes:\n|> \n|> I don\'t understand the point of this petty sarcasm.

Only a very small percentage of microlife is\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I\'m sure you\'ll agree. But\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn\'t do as\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\nthe past.

I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\nseems unlikely that Satan, who\'s making the diseases, would also gift\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\n\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\n>humanity forsook God\'s protection.\n\n Here\'s another puzzle.

A \'perfect\' system\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\nperfect system.

Clarke\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\nOrig. Ed. 1993\nPre-publication $84.50\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\n\n\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\nreach them.   \n\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\n\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\nfictional\n\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\ncontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare\nillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and\ndrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and\nobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA\narchives\n\nAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)\nPart II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)\nPart III The Experimenters (1900-1938)\nPart IV The World War (1939-1945)\nPart V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)\nPart VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)\n\nABOUT RON MILLER\n\n[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the high\nspots.]\n\nFormer art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian's\nNational Air and Space Museum\n\nMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of\nInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British\nInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space\nSmithsonian* magazine\n\nAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since\n1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and\nmany others, as well as many articles and papers\n\nBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers \n\nContributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*\n\nProduction illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*\n\nDesigner of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for\nU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)\n\nORDERING INFORMATION\n\nPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993\nAfterwards, price will be $112.50\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nPO Box 9542\nMelbourne, FL 32902-9542\nUSA\nDirect order line (407)727-7270\nFax (407)951-3671\n\nAdd $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each\nadditional book.  \n\nFor foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each\nadditional.

But thanks\nto major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL\'s\nSpace Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major project\nconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is "alive\nand well," according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.\n     A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have\nadded up to a less expensive project with "tremendous scientific\npower" and a bright future, said Werner.\n     Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful Infrared\nAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer\n(COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for\ninfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000\nor 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.\n     IRAS\' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10\nyears ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never\nbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25\ncomets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than\nany previously available from ground-based observations. COBE has\nmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large\nangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.\n     But to illuminate SIRTF\'s potential, Jim Evans, JPL\'s\nmanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,\nrecently said that the project is "1,000 to 1 million times more\ncapable than IRAS," based on technological advances in infrared\ndetector arrays.\n     However, despite the enormous strides in infrared\nexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as the\nhighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s\n(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a "diet or die"\ndirective from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project\ngoing, according to Werner.\n     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the key\nfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the sun\ninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocket\nlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. "The\nmain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your\nlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don\'t have to\ncarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit," Werner said.\nThe other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that "it\'s in a\nbetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth."\n     Additional major changes in SIRTF\'s redesign include\nshortening the mission from five to three years and building a\nspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original\nplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)\ncompared to Titan SIRTF\'s 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).\n     All of that adds up to "a less stressful launch\nenvironment," Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200\nmillion for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the\ndesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.\n     Werner said SIRTF\'s redesign came as a result of Congress\'\ntelling NASA "you\'re trying to do too many things. If you want us\nto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to see\nhow it fits into (NASA\'s) overall strategy."\n     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA\'s highest\npriority "flagship" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary\nSpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessing\nfrom the National Academy of Sciences.\n     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping\nto keep the project alive, SIRTF\'s major scientific contribution\nalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector\narrays, which will allow images to be developed "tens of\nthousands of times faster" than before, according to Evans.\n     "Up until a couple of years ago," Werner said, "all infrared\nastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays\nof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Department\nof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or\nhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and\nthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF."\n     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget\npressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an\neye out for any "technological spinoff."\n     "On that question, I think we have some things to say," he\nsaid, "because the detectors we\'re using are straight off various\nmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.\naerospace industry, and it\'s a real technological and engineering\nchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.\n     "SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,"\nWerner added, but the revised three-year mission "puts a premium\non observing time. We have to educate the user community and\ndevelop a program that involves early surveys and quick\nturnaround of the data."\n     Werner said the downsizing of the project required a\nreduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF\'s three instruments --\nthe infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband\nimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result in\nlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.\n     The project hopes to start a "Phase B" activity in 1995,\nwhich will provide a detailed concept for development and design.\nBuilding the hardware would begin about two years later.\n     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950\nmillion.\n     "I am very optimistic about SIRTF," he said. "It will\nprovide a tremendous return for the investment."\n     Werner added that an additional benefit from the project\nwill be the "enrichment of our intellectual and cultural\nenvironment. People on the street are very interested in\nastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other\nplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of\nquestions SIRTF will help answer."\n                              ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n', 'From:  (Rashid)\nSubject: Re: Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\nNntp-Posting-Host: nstlm66\nOrganization: NH\nLines: 231\n\nIn article <1993Apr17.044430.801@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au>,\ndarice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice) wrote:\n> \nStuff deleted\n> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter\n> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

This is very well shown in the book "Punishment in Islamic Law"\n> by Mohamed S. El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981).\n> \n\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\'an.\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\n\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon "God and\nHis Messenger" the situation changes. Now the charge of\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\'s case.\n\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\'an between a formal war situation\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of "fasad" that \nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\n\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\nMuslims, and Rushdie\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\n\n\n> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter\n> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

I believe\nthat one of the Qur\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\nEvery verse in the Qur\'an has a corresponding "circumstance of\nrevelation" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\nIt is not necessarily a simple "this or that" process. There may\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\nimpinge on the situation.\n\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\'an.\nThe Qur\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\nthe\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\n\n"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\nthe Qur\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\nthe Qur\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\'an....".\n\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\'anic\nverses ("Why should not a company from every group remain behind \nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware." (9:122)),\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\'ve listed a few major \ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\nheadings.\n\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\n- Logic (mantiq)\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\nReasoning)\n\nThe study of Qur\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\n- discussion of tacit meanings\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\n\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\n- principles of exemption\n- principles of precaution\n- principles of option\n- principles of mastery\n\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \n\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\nfamous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says:\n"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\nand wealth of this world." The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: "O Messenger\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?" He (S.A.) replied:\n"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\nyour religion and shun them." I do not yet know enough about the Imams\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\n\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as "The fortress of Islam". My only\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \ndelineated in the Qur\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\nare praised in both the Qur\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \nare cautioned.\n\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\napostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least\nbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a\nheretic\nbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of\ncreating a straw man and then beating him.\n\n> Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam.  Please\n> email me, Rashid, if you think we should do this.\n\nI agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.\nUnfortunately,\nI do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated\ngroup\nis out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like\nsoc.religion.islam.

The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this\ngroup, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would\nseriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and\nmail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  \n\nFirst of all, I\'ve tried to structure questions that can be answered in a\nvariety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it\'s possible to give \nsuccinct answers to most everything, but there\'s enough here to keep most of \nyou typing for hours, I\'m sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean \nit) is great, but it\'s also important for me to have as broad a base of \nindividuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing\n-- it\'s a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  \n\nSecondly, I hope some of the questions don\'t come off as obnoxious; I know that\nphrases like "What would convince you of the existence of God" imply that I am\na seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.\nIn fact, I\'m not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my\nuse of "God" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it\'s easier \nthan just repeating "a deity or higher power" every time.  \n\nAlso, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like "belief system"\nalthough I know some of you might contend that you don\'t have ANY beliefs, but\nare skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.\nThink of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases \nrequired to get the precise idea across.  \n\nLastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as\nyou can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  \n\n---------------\n\nWhere would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum \n\tTheism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  \nFeel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  \n\n\nIn what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe \nin the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume \nthat the answer to this is "yes;" if you\'ve always been an atheist, or at\nleast never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)\n\n\nHow serious was your/your family\'s involvement?  \n\nHow and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  \n\nHow and when did your "final break" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I \nrealize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an "event" per se;\nwhatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  \n\n\nWhat contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)\nyour "conversion" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism\ncounts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  \n\nTo what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your\nbeliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \n\n\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \n\n\nTo what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your beliefs?\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \nan explanatory method?  \n\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would\nconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the \nplausibility of God\'s existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs\n-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for\nsome time?  \n\nAre you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you\nthink science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science\nwas the new "secular religion," and that "scientists are, in a very real sense,\nthe new priesthood."  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-\nreligious base, or even a religious element?)  \n\n---------------\n\nThis survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but\nalso to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose\nideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have\nme, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your\nbeliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.  \n\n---------------\n\nThanks again.

Can you see that?\n\nI don\'t deny this fact.\n\nThe thrust of my argument here is that \n\n(a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found\nguilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\n\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \ndistinction.\n\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say "Muslim".  In\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a "Muslim" and does not do or \noutwardly profess\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\n\nThe term "Muslim" is to be contrasted with "Mu\'min", which means "true\nbeliever".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\'min is\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\nwill not find the term Mu\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\nfor example, am a "true believer" or not.  For example, I could just be\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say "Muslims"\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\n"Muslim" we do not necessarily mean "Mu\'min", or "true believer" in\nIslam.\n\n Fred Rice\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n\n', 'From: higgins@fnalf.fnal.gov (Bill Higgins-- Beam Jockey)\nSubject: Sixty-two thousand (was Re: How many read sci.space?)\nOrganization: Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory\nLines: 67\nNNTP-Posting-Host: fnalf.fnal.gov\n\nIn article <1993Apr15.072429.10206@sol.UVic.CA>, rborden@ugly.UVic.CA (Ross  Borden) writes:\n> In article <734850108.F00002@permanet.org> Mark.Prado@p2.f349.n109.z1.permanet.org (Mark Prado) writes:\n>>\n>>One could go on and on and on here, but I wonder ... how\n>>many people read sci.space and of what power/influence are\n>>these individuals?\n>>\n> \tQuick!

It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\nprecedent in the Qur\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\n\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of "fasad". This\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\n\n\n> Stuff deleted\n> Also, I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that\n> Khomeini\'s fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.  My\n> understanding is that Khomeini\'s fatwa was issued in response to the\n> _writing_ and _publishing_ of the book.  If my view is correct, then\n> your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for a "crime in progress" is\n> incorrect.\n> \nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\nof the book. However, the charge of "fasad" can encompass a\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\n"crisis". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\nlevelled at people, not books.\n\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\npoint that the fatwa on "fasad" was issued.\n\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\n\nP.S. I\'m not sure about this but I think the charge of "shatim" also\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\nof the "fasad" ruling.\n', 'From: geoff@East.Sun.COM (Geoff Arnold @ Sun BOS - R.H. coast near the top)\nSubject: Re: Where are they now?\nOrganization: SunSelect\nLines: 22\nDistribution: world\nReply-To: geoff@East.Sun.COM\nNNTP-Posting-Host: poori.east.sun.com\n\nYour posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable\nposts.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved." - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ\'s second coming.  Also know as "the time of Jacob\'s\n(Israel\'s) trouble" (Jere 30:7) and "Daniel\'s Seventieth Week" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  "And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\'s\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) "...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed." Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ "...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands." - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.  "...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb." -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\'s government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist\'s control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n["As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\'s\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be "faithful unto death."\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  "Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up." -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n', "From: wb8foz@skybridge.SCL.CWRU.Edu (David Lesher)\nSubject: Re: No. Re: Space Marketing would be wonderfull.\nOrganization: NRK Clinic for habitual NetNews abusers - Beltway Annex\nLines: 11\nReply-To: wb8foz@skybridge.scl.cwru.edu (David Lesher)\nNNTP-Posting-Host: skybridge.scl.cwru.edu\n\nOthers said:\n# >Coca Cola company will want to paint the moon red and white.

You got me thinking now!\n\nThis is an interesting question in that recently there has been a \nmove in society to classify previously "socially unacceptable" yet legal \nactivities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two \ncoexisting methods of social control.\n\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \nof punishments.\n\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \nsocial censure.\n\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as "guilt" and \n"morality".  I\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\'t for \nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \nabsolutely impossible.\n\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\'t \nillegal, then don\'t pick on me).  I\'m not saying this is wrong, merely \nthat it is a byproduct of a society which has:\n\n\t1) A high education level,\n\t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,\n\t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and\n\t4) A "me" oriented culture.\n\nI guess what I\'m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, \nhere in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\\ncan\'t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we \nare fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as \nthose freedoms don\'t impinge on another\'s.\n\nIMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we \nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \ncontinued destabilization of society.  \n\nI got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this \nmess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms \nin order to "stabilize" society.  Yet I believe development of societies \nfollow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a \nsocial model which maximizes indiv. freed.\'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is \npossible to live with a "non-stable" society?\n\nAnybody see a way out?  Comments?\n\nPS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don\'t.

If a philosopher\nis not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.\n\nA Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is\na special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,\nto conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence\nof That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma\ncomes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways\'\' is an example\nof faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.\nSure, interpretations of what ``God said\'\' are changed to satisfy the\nneeds of society, but when God says something, that\'s it.  It was said,\nand that\'s that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the\ninterpretations are flawed.\n\nScience, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a\nBUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.\nA scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to\nsuit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,\n*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs\nare deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving\nthe beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect\nthe best information currently available.  That\'s the only rational\nthing to do.  That\'s good philosophy.\n\nCan you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,\nand new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many\nscientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding\nof everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion\nviews its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of\nthose beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which\nconflicts with them.\n>\n>Please explain how "just because" thinking kills people.

An atheist does not\nbelieve in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as \ncapital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.  \n\nIf you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I \npresume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us\nall together.\n\nAs for the issues, let\'s start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support\nabortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact.\nHowever, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless\nof what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell\nany individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain\nof legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That\'s my opinion, and I\nam sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.\n\nI do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I \ncertainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would\nbe angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as\nnothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.  \n\nAs for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what\nyou\'re talking about.\n\nFinally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist\ncan object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to\nbe hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and \npopulation control.

The "large"\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\nthe energy they have absorbed.\n\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\nby any conceivable observation.\n\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\npopulation of "small" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\n"average" temperature.\n\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\n\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\nAllen\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\ncooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of\nstarlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave\nbackground, and I believe that to be correct.)\n\n                         Dilution   Temp.

Space Science\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\ngenerate interest in the project. I\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\nthe meeting. Here goes : \n\n\t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\n\t\t\t-------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \'conventional\' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n3.Missions\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\nrate.\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\nbase, BTW]\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\ncontainer.\n\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\ninformation.\n\n\tAndy\n\n\n\n-- \n                                  ----------------------------------- \nAndy Jonathan J.

According to the above poster, we must believe\n in objects or beings that haven\'t been proved not to exist so why stop at\n God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan\n except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond\n hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can\'t see them)  The \n reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians\n have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.\n\n>Fine, but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of\n>a God?

(This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren\'t atheists - don\'t they contradict\n  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant\n  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists\n  can\'t value life as much as theists (which you didn\'t support).  \n\n>\tAgnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable.

An atheist\n doesn\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\'t exist, he/she may\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\'s the example:\n \n Strong atheism - "I believe god does not exist"   a positive belief\n\n Weak atheism   - "I don\'t believe in a god"       a negative belief\n \n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\'s look at it this way (in sets)\n \n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:\n \n christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god\n \n atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)\n \n atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set\n \n agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E\', ....) \n\n\n>\tWhy are people so afraid to say "undecided"?

If the code was once perfect, and\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\nof this statement, shouldn\'t we?\n\nPerhaps the biggest "imperfection" of the code is that it is full\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\n\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \n\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \n\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\ngenetics before posting "theological arguments" like this. \nTry Watson\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\n& Baltimore\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\n\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\n: theological perspective -- my own.

Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\n\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\nmore important than we\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \n \n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\n\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \n\n: Actually, neither of us "knows" what the atmosphere was like at the\n: time when God created life.

Biology and Genetics are\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don\'t explain\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\n\nWhy is there a "why behind"? And your proposition was something\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\nthese books.\n\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\n \n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\n: of biology and genetics, although I\'m sure I\'d find it a\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\n: environment.\n\nI\'m sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,\nand no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.\nIt can come into existence without a Supreme Being.\n\nTry reading P.W.

Larson, 1984, North \n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \n          hardcover. \n          \n\n               "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \n          \n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \n          edition of "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE", 1959.  \n          Volume I is "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979), and Volume II is \n          "THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988). \n          \n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \n          validity. \n          \n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \n          they contain. \n          \n               "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" describes the astrophysical \n          portions of Larson\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \n          "grand unified field theory" that orthodox physicists and \n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \n          space and time: \n          \n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \n          \n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \n          \n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \n          ready for those also. \n          \n               As a result of his theory, which he called "THE \n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \n          "nuclear" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \n          solutions in principle, "no other way" declarations, etc., \n          used to maintain them. \n          \n               "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" is divided into 31 chapters.  \n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \n          formation from the MYTHICAL "big bang" is a big mystery to \n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \n          SINGLE stars. \n          \n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \n          \n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \n          observations that contradict their theories would find \n          Larson\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \n          coincidence).  Larson\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the "cosmic \n          sector".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \n          at random. \n          \n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \n          "Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey", by William K. Hartmann, \n          says, "Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot."  Larson\'s book contains \n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \n\n\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\'s BOOKS). \n\n\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \n\n          \n                                   Robert E.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents\' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe\'re going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t\nsustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let\'s not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.

"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives."\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour\'s June flight and Discovery\'s July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.\n\n- end -\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n', 'From: pgf@srl03.cacs.usl.edu (Phil G.

They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\n    microfilm.\n\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\'s vintage hardware (like\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\n    from.\n\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\n    sheet design.\n\n\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\n\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\n    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently\n    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early\n    in a mission.\n\n\n    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES\n\n    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to\n    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium\n    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\n\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\n    pursue are:\n\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\n    Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\n    Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Studies\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\n    study, Charles Jackman.\n\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\n\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\n\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Shuttle sources:\t  725,000 kilograms/year\n\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\n\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\n\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\n    do at the present time.\n\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\n    Shuttle\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\n\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\n    you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\n\n    References:\n\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\n    Alfred G.

This is\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\n    team\'s medical/forensic report.\n\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\n\n\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\n\n    You can\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\n    because it can\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\n    specialized for travel between Earth\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\n    spacecraft.\n\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\n\n\n    THE "FACE ON MARS"\n\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\n\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\'t\n    know the address) to study the Face.\n\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\n    sci.astro.\n\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

Mckissock)\nSubject: NASA "Wraps"\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \nNntp-Posting-Host: tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov\nOrganization: NASA Lewis Research Center / Cleveland, Ohio\nLines: 133\n\nIn the April edition of "One Small Step for a Space Activist",\nAllen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:\n  "Another problem is what are called \'wraps\' (or sometimes\n   the \'center tax\'). When work for a large program like\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won\'t be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\'t), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term \'center tax\'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else."\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\'t post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I\'m supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of \'center tax\', or \'wrap\' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \'tax\'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter \'taxes\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\'t if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don\'t have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1/3, but it\'s only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question "What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don\'t go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\'t eaten\nup by the center tax?)"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my \'home\' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the \'tax\' does not all\ngo into a \'slush fund.\' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \'general\'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn\'t go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is \'billable\' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\na burecratic nightmare!\n\nMy last point is that I can\'t believe your claim that\nCongress has never heard of the term \'center tax.\'\nUnfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before\nCongress isn\'t on a computer, so I can\'t do a simple\nword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,\nin some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods\nwere documented for Congress?\n', "From: higgins@fnalf.fnal.gov (Bill Higgins-- Beam Jockey)\nSubject: Re: Science News article on Federal R&D\nOrganization: Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory\nLines: 24\nNNTP-Posting-Host: fnalf.fnal.gov\n\nIn article <C5r2DK.764@skates.gsfc.nasa.gov>, xrcjd@resolve.gsfc.nasa.gov (Charles J.

His anti-Islamic\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\non telling half-truths.\n\nAgain, read "Orientalism" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\n_yourself_.\n\n>The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES,\n>when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex.\n>I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines, I wrote an\n>incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not\n>want his concubine to get pregnant etc., which is contrary\n>to the notion that "sex is for procreation only".

I just reposted a\nvery good one, under the title "Islam and Women", reposted from\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\nexcellent article.  \n\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\n\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\ncompletely on the Qur\'an and contains numerous Qur\'anic verses and\nhadiths to support its point of view.\n\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\'an\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\ncourse not.\n\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\nyou.  The Qur\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says "I am a\nMuslim" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\nonly an idiot would think so.\n\nDo you see my point?\n\n>It is very natural to think that\n>the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic\n>structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm\n>shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of \n>the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial \n>revolution.

Capitalism is an\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\n\n>When this stopped,\n>you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.\n>No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education\n>level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world, the health\n>statistics are miserable etc.. \n\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\n\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\nIslam => lack of education and power.\n\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\nother reasons for this situation.\n\n>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims \n>for following the Quran. \n\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\nfollowing the Qur\'an or not.\n\n>Your idea is baseless from historical\n>facts, it is a poor utopia, \n\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by "following the Qur\'an"\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\nfact which contradicts your theory. \n\n>while my ideas are derived from social\n>and economic history. \n\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\nthis.\n\n>My solution to all Muslims is simple:\n>CUT THE CRAP, \n\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\n\n>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT \n\nHere too.\n\n>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE\n>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.\n\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\n\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\nhave.\n\n Fred Rice\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n', "From: bobbe@vice (Robert Beauchaine;6086;59-323;LP=A;YAyG)\nSubject: Re: Asimov stamp\nOrganization: Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, Or.\nLines: 22\n\nIn article <schnitzi.735603785@eustis> schnitzi@eustis.cs.ucf.edu (Mark Schnitzius) writes:\n>\n>I'm sure all the religious types would get in a snit due\n>to Asimov's atheism.\n>\n>Do we have any atheists on stamps now?\n>\n>\n  Due to a discussion on this group some time ago, the theists would\n  more likely take an Asimov quote out of context and paint him as\n  the biggest Bible thumpin', God fearin', atheist hatin' christian\n  you ever laid eyes on.

Put my name\non the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really\noffensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or\npublisher), and read it, "cover to cover" (to use a phrase that seems\npopular here right now).\n\nAnd I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but\nit was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie\ngrew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in\nNew Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the\nstrange constructions of Indian English: the "yaar" at the end of a\nsentence, "Butbutbut," the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)\n\nAt the time I still "sorta-kinda" thought of myself as a muslim, and I\ncouldn\'t see what the flap was all about.

It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who\ntook on the names and personae of Muhammed\'s wives, and had not (as my\ngrandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed\'s wives were prostitutes; in\nshort, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to\nhave missed the point completely.  (And I won\'t mention the fact that the\nmost militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)\n\nPerhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it\nexposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity\nneed an agent? She can come directly to me, can\'t she? How do we know that\nMuhammed didn\'t just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how\ndo we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn\'t screw up, or\nput in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four\nwomen, when no other muslim is allowed to?

It was a bit shorter\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\nbare-bones.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\nin.\n\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\n\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\nthe difference.\n\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \n\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\n\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\npart first.\n\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\n\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\nthis point.\n\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\nto persue work on their own.\n\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\ntrying to do something with it.  \n\nAnybody know anything further?\nIs this really news?\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?\n\n                    John.\n", 'From: mccall@mksol.dseg.ti.com (fred j mccall 575-3539)\nSubject: Re: Alaska Pipeline and Space Station!\nOrganization: Texas Instruments Inc\nLines: 45\n\nIn <1pq7rj$q2u@access.digex.net> prb@access.digex.com (Pat) writes:\n\n>In article <1993Apr5.160550.7592@mksol.dseg.ti.com> mccall@mksol.dseg.ti.com (fred j mccall 575-3539) writes:\n>|\n>|I think this would be a great way to build it, but unfortunately\n>|current spending rules don\'t permit it to be workable.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\'t like it\n- that\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any "absolute" sense.\nThat you don\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\'ve been\nconditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\nI didn\'t make these rules, it\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\netc. and cannot participate.

Where you derive \nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\'s a sort of\nliar\'s paradox: "force is necessary for freedom".   One possible justification\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\'t object if\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\'t arise if\nwe don\'t actively wish to take way anyone\'s freedom.\n#\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\n#\n#They see the need for a "justice" system.

Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person\'s\nself-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely\nmental/verbal level, and don\'t usually find expression in society except in an\nimpure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.

We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - "you\'ve lost it!"  The "me" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened\nto your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn\nV\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!\n\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\nAmerican.

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\n\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\nvieren de benoeming van hun \'oervader\' middels een breed scala\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\n\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\n\'compacte objecten\', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\neen apart vel.\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde.

Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\ntrachten te verklaren.\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\n\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can\'t find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\'t set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\'ll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5.

(Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you\'ve tried the above methods and they\'ve failed; it\'s not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\'t have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n\n\nmathew\nÿ\n', 'From: pgf@srl03.cacs.usl.edu (Phil G.

I\nread his "Satanic Bible" a few years ago for a social studies project,\nas well as a book by Arthur Lyons called "The Cult of Devil Worship\nin America."  The latter included a very interesting interview with\nthe Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an\ninstrument for one to realize the self.  \n\nWhen I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic\nritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I\ndon\'t consider LaVey\'s church to be at all "orthodox," nor do I consider\nits followers "satanists."  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,\nCrowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little\ntouch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.\nNo doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I\nsuppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.\n\nAt any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a\nhuge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.\nand Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the \nway.)  \n\nI find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as\na Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of\nSatan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster\'s Dictionary\nand The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same.\n-- \n---                      __  _______                              ---\n||| Kevin Marshall       \\ \\/ /_  _/  Computer Science Department |||\n||| Virginia Tech         \\  / / /     marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu |||\n--- Blacksburg, Virginia   \\/ /_/                  (703) 232-6529 ---\n', 'From: I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de (Benedikt Rosenau)\nSubject: Re: Yeah, Right\nOrganization: Technical University Braunschweig, Germany\nLines: 54\n\nIn article <66014@mimsy.umd.edu>\nmangoe@cs.umd.edu (Charley Wingate) writes:\n \n>>And what about that revelation thing, Charley?\n>\n>If you\'re talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation, well,\n>it\'s obviously a risk one takes.\n>\n \nI see, it is not rational, but it is intellectual.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn\'s rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment.

"mothership" except\nfor Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a\n"Grand Tour" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt \nthat\nthe idea of a big "mother ship" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\nIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\'s?) had a lot in\ncommon with the British Interplanetary Society\'s Daedalus project for sending a\nprobe to Barnard\'s Star - i.e. a large "bus" spacecraft carrying several\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\nThe Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\nJupiter and beyond. The "bus" could have included far more powerful\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\nrelatively great distance.\n---\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the "real" Voyagers,\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\naddition two "sub-probes" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\nthat planet\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\nsystems that weren\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\ntrajectory-related factors. A small "swarm" of camera-equipped miniature space\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \nwell-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer\nplanets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of\ncourse. \n\nMARCU$\n   \n> ==\n> Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I\'m not high, just jacked\n> \n', "From: henry@zoo.toronto.edu (Henry Spencer)\nSubject: Re: Deployable Space Dock..\nOrganization: U of Toronto Zoology\nLines: 19\n\nIn article <1993Apr30.000050.1@aurora.alaska.edu> nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu writes:\n>Why not build a inflatable space dock.\n\nIf you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in\na pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.

In most countries, for most of\nhistory, it was probably true that the rulers `owned\' everything\nnot explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America,\nwhere by the principle enunciated, the aboriginal inhabitants should\nhave owned everything, when new arrivals wanted to use land\nand resources, they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn\'t noticed,\nthere is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what.\nOf course, if some friendly super power were to give an international\nastronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree\nto defend it if attacked, such a proposal might work, but it\nwould hardly be non-coercive.\n\nSome of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first\nto try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space\nand also to use governmental actions (like taxing power, for example)\nto discourage them.

They\'re\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\nat working out the method itself.\n\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \'obfuscate\' the trick, and\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\nmaterial, much of which isn\'t used.\n\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \'if you see\nobject X, then perform action Y,\' and we don\'t seem to get anywhere.\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\nconclusions to draw from it\'s experience.\n\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\'s\ncode?\n\nThe next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?" (replace\n\'colour\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\'s the product of some kind of\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\ncomputer won\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\nequivalent that doesn\'t? It shouldn\'t, because the outputs of each\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\nwe see colour?\n\n\n>\n>However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be\n>able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue\n>commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions\n>occur?\n\nA bit of idle speculation...\n\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\n\'Unitary Evolution\' (or \'U\'), is governed by Schroedinger\'s equation\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\n\'collapse of the wavefunction\' or \'state vector reduction\' (or \'R\'),\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\n\'measurement\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\nchange the wavefunction.\n\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \'something\nelse,\' which I shall imaginitively call \'part X.\' It seems reasonable\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\'d need more than U to explain R.)\n\nAnyway, I\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\nexplainations for this. I\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\'t matter too\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\nphysics.\n\nI\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\'s OK with you :-)\n\n>\n>\n>Petri\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\n            Don\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', "From: prb@access.digex.net (Pat)\nSubject: Re: Vandalizing the sky\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications USA\nLines: 13\nDistribution: sci\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\nIn article <C6BIr5.InC.1@cs.cmu.edu> 18084TM@msu.edu (Tom) writes:\n|On the other hand, I lived in OakBrook IL for a while, where zoning\n|laws prohibit billboards, as you mention above.

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

[said]  Western \nobservers had concluded that no more would be launched.

There\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\nas salary.\n\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\' expertise.  This is\nprobably because of the "research mind" approach, which is not to try\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\n\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\n\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, "Get the money from NSF."  Now the\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\nget supported, and how much.  \n\nAlso, the government decided that the "wealth" should be spread.  So instead\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\nwhich solves yesterday\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \n\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.\n-- \nHerman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399\nPhone: (317)494-6054\nhrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  \n{purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)\n', 'From: bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine)\nSubject: Re: Amusing atheists and agnostics\nOrganization: Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, Or.\nLines: 18\n\nIn article <madhausC5rFqo.9qL@netcom.com> madhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann) writes:\n>\n>"Clam" Bake Timmons = Bill "Shit Stirrer Connor"\n>\n\n  Sorry, gotta disagree with you on this one Maddi (not the\n  resemblence to Bill.

The age of the universe has no direct effect on\nhumanity\'s sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can\nhave.\n\n      I\'m saying the Universe has a "real age", because I see evidence\nfor it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of\npeople\'s opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of\ndifferent opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem\nto give roughly the same results.\n\n>#      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be\n>#emirically verified through means that\'ll give the same result no matter\n>#who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the\n>#largish side...). \n> \n> This assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality\n> which doesn\'t depend on what we think.\n\n      I can\'t see how it does that.

They don\'t, which I take\nas showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.\n\n>#I\'ve heard of no way to verify morality in a\n>#consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to\n>#enlighten me?\n> \n> The same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted\n> to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.\n\n      Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean\nphysical pain.

Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within*\n*that* *moral* *system*.

I\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\n\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\n\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President\'s new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation."\n\nNASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-\nWest Space Science Center at the University of Maryland\nunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\n\n', "From: bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (Bill Conner)\nSubject: Re: Dear Mr. Theist\nNntp-Posting-Host: okcforum.osrhe.edu\nOrganization: Okcforum Unix Users Group\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nLines: 20\n\nPixie (dl2021@andy.bgsu.edu) wrote:\n\n:      For all the problems technology has caused, your types have made\n: things even worse.

D1).  I thought I\'d post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, "What\'s New" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\'s clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mind\nchildren" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America\'s Space Age won\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\'s science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\'s\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\nits competitiveness agenda.\n\n......\n\n"I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen\nnow," says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.

I hope you would accept the fact that \nfor instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical\nreasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.\n\nI think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might \nrevise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems.\n\nCheers,\nKent\n\n---\nsandvik@newton.apple.com.

I can\'t imagine the FAA allowing\n>people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes.\n>Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.\n\nNope, it\'s not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to \npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\none of the following:\na) An employee of a government agency.\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\n\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\n\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\n\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\'\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \n\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an "F" motor are exempt from\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\nC, for details.\n\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\n\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\n\n>And no, I\'m not going to even think of buying one.  I\'m not that crazy.\n\nWhy not? It\'s a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets\nfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything\nbigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to\npractice safety. I\'ve been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs\ntakeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.\n\n>-Paul "mine\'ll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite" Dokas\n\nThat\'s another thing.

Let me suggest a scenario.\n\n We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicate\nwith humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your\nown words) \'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck,\nmakes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years\'.)\n Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a\nrevelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem\nto contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the\nobserved world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are\nmany mutually contradictory claims of revelation.\n\n Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent\na personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly\nnothing to this \'revelation\' thing?\n\n>I\'m not an objectivist, so I\'m not particularly impressed with problems of\n>conceptualization.

I\nhave come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is\nnothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.\n Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held\naccountable for such an honest mistake?\n\n Sincerely,\n\n Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu\n\n "The meek can *have* the Earth.

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n"Galactic Pot-Healer"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n"A Maze of Death"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n"VALIS"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n"The Divine Invasion"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n"The Handmaid\'s Tale"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\'s life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\'s right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n"The Bible"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\'ll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n"Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: "Gottes erste Diener.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\'s "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised\nedition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n"The Miracle of Theism", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for\nGod" such as Lelie\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin\'s works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

If you are surveying our individual\nphilosophies, fine, but that\'s not strictly atheism. Atheism is not\njust another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,\nthe universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could\nhardly be called a philosophical system.\n\nOnce more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. \nDo not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of\nphilosophy we all agree on.\n\nSome comments on your questions:\n\n> What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)\n> your "conversion" to atheism?

You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become\natheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily\nbecome atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems\nit requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that\nreligions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.\n\nThose who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question\nquite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire\nlack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))\n\n> To what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your \n> beliefs?

And  Peter remembered\nthe word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou\nshalt deny me thrice.\n\nJOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? \nVerily,\n verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me\nthrice.\n\nJOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.\n\n>destruction of cities (what said was jeremiah was zechariah)\n\n(This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made! \nNot the only time he does this either...)\n\nMAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet, \nsaying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was\nvalued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;\n\nzechariah 11:11-13\n(nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)\n\nWhat was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?\n\nscarlet - Matthew 27:28\n\npurple John 19:2\n\n>The time of the Crucifiction\n\nMark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was\nwhen the sentence was passed.\n\n>Inscription on the Cross\n\nMatthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews\nMark\t --  The King of the Jews\nLuke\t --  This is the king of the Jews\nJohn\t --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews\n\n>What did they give him to drink?\n\nvinegar - Matthew 27:34\n\nwine with myrrh - Mark 15:23\n\n>Women at the Cross\n\nMatthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of\nJames, and the mother of Zebedee\'s children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far\noff, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.\nJohn says that Jesus\'s mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and\nMary Magdalene.\n\n>Jesus\' last words \n\nMatt.27:46,50: "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \nsaying, "Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, why\nhast thou forsaken me?"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,\nyielded u the ghost."\n\nLuke23:46: "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, unto\n thy hands I commend my spirit:" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."\n\nJohn19:30: "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is \nfinished:" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."\n\n>Events of the crucifiction\n\nMatthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an\nearthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves\nopened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to\nmany (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and\nthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. \nJohn is the only one who mentions Jesus\'s side being peirced.\n\n>Burial of Jesus\n\nMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being\nstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\n\n>How long was Jesus in the tomb?\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\nspend "three days and three nights in the heart of the earth", and Mark 10:34\nhas "after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again". As far as I can\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have "after three days", but the\npost-resurrection narratives have "on the third day".\n\n>Time of the Resurection\n\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\nwas dark.\n\n> Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :\n\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\n\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\nanoint him.\n\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\nsepulchre.\n\n>Whom did they see at the tomb?\n\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\nand sat upon it.\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\n\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\n\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\n>Belief that the disciples stole Jesus\'s body\n\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\nthis claim.\n\n>Appearences of the risen Jesus\n\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\nto the visit with the disciples.\n\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\n\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\nthey told the\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\nand honey and then preached to them.\n\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce\nmore Jesus made an\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\nrecognised.\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\ntogether and converse.\n\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\npertaining to the kingdom of God: "And when he had spoken these things, while\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven" Acts 1:3-11\n\nPaul outdoes every other "authority" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\nassension, although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself "as\none born out of due time" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\n\n>The Ascension\n\nMatthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \nJohn says nothing about it.  Acts\ncontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)\n\n>When second coming?\n\nMAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all\nthese things be fulfilled.\n\nMAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till\nall these things be done.\n\nLUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till\nall be fulfilled.\n\n1 thessalonians 4:15-18\n\n>How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention \n1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)\nMatthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)\nActs 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)\nMAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain\nwhere Jesus had appointed them.\n\n> ascend to heaven\n\t"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." (2 Kings 2:11)\n\n\t"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, \t...\nthe Son of Man." (John 3:13)\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the\ntrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,\nyou would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! \n(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think\nthat they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly\nobserving!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,\nthe story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.\n(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of\ntruth.)\n\n                   Alan\n\n', 'From: deguzman@after.math.uiuc.edu (A A DeGuzman)\nSubject: Re: YOU WILL ALL GO TO HELL!!!\nDistribution: na\nReply-To: a-deguzman@uiuc.edu\nOrganization: Calculus&Mathematica at UIUC\nLines: 26\n\ndecay@cbnewsj.cb.att.com (dean.kaflowitz) writes:\n\n>In article <C5LH4p.27K@portal.hq.videocart.com>, dfuller@portal.hq.videocart.com (Dave Fuller) writes:\n>> JSN104@psuvm.psu.edu () writes:\n>> : YOU BLASHEPHEMERS!!!

Hawking, whose theories attempt to\nexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate\ndimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, "because while\nI\'m most interested in those things in space that are farther\naway, I know that here is where the first steps are taken."\n     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate\nstudents and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,\nas David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of\nFlight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer\'s project\nscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.\n     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid\nto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should\nextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,\nthey would find a variety of images that would explain something\nof Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with\nthe spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.\n     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes\ndescribing the project and the spacecraft\'s features. In answer\nto a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed\ndrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it\'s only\na concept." Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five\nyears before, described the professor as "a living miracle of the\npower of the brain. He\'s miraculous, and he has such a good sense\nof humor."\n     The next stop, a demonstration on scientific data\nvisualization in Section 384\'s Digital Image Animation Lab,\nentertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles\nto view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong\nshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been\ndiscovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about\nits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he\nasked several questions on their interpretation.\n     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data\nAcquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations\nFacility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.\n     The day ended with two technical discussions of particular\ninterest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank\nEstabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described\na three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.\nThen planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the\nphilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.\n     The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern\nCalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and\nplanned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab\ntour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promised\nChahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.\n                          ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n', "From: prb@access.digex.com (Pat)\nSubject: Re: Comet in Temporary Orbit Around Jupiter?\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications USA\nLines: 23\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\nIn article <6APR199314571378@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov> baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (Ron Baalke) writes:\n|Comet Gehrels 3, which was discovered in 1977, was determined to have\n|been in a temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973.

Have no statistical\n   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will\n   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will\n   be.  Most software production is at this level.\n\n2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project\n   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects\n   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration\n   management and quality assurance.\n\n3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is\n   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a\n   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,\n   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the\n   project.\n\n4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered\n   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this\n   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.\n\n5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts\n   are effective and certified.\n\nNick Haines nickh@cmu.edu\n", 'From: Tony Lezard <tony@mantis.co.uk>\nSubject: Re: atheist?\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Mantis Consultants, Cambridge.

Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn\'t be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\'ll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\'d bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn\'t give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\'d\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\nbody produced, how much lunar material it\'d need for protection from solar\nflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don\'t remember the name of this magazine. \nDoes this ring a bell to anyone?\n\nCraig Keithley                    |"I don\'t remember, I don\'t recall, \nApple Computer, Inc.              |I got no memory of anything at all"\nkeithley@apple.com                |Peter Gabriel, Third Album (1980)\n', 'From: steinly@topaz.ucsc.edu (Steinn Sigurdsson)\nSubject: Re: Gamma Ray Bursters.

I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\'s rather pointless\nto debate the so called "existence" of God - and that is not what\nI\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\nbeing. When you say that "god does not exist", I also accept this\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\nin what follows I will use the phrase "the existence of God" in it\'s\n\'usual sense\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by "the existence of\nGod".\n \nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\nWebster says:\n\nfaith \n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\nb  (1): fidelity to one\'s promises\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   (2): complete trust\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nof religious beliefs\nsyn see BELIEF\n\n\n\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\n"based upon observation", I will have to ask "what observtions are\nyou refering to?" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \npartents "believe in God" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\nabout the "existence" or "non-existence" of God requires a leap - and\nyou have made this leap when you actively say "I believe that God  \ndoes/does not exist". Personally, I think that both statements are\nmisguided. Arguing over the "existence" of God is precisely the wrong way\nto find Him (and yes, I use "Him" because a personal God is the only \nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use "She" go ahead. Of course \nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\'ll be \nglad to.) \n\n\n\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \ndisagree - it\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \nthinks I\'ve misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \nways and I correct the situation.

Bursts are\nusually more complex than this example I will use here.\n        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration\nof 8.95 seconds.

Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.\n        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several\ndifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the\ngalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a\nR=8800Mpc.  \n        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the\nold standby formula:\n                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak\n        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.

Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\nin the future perform a "total synthesis of C. elegans" from\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\n\n> Firstly, I\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms.

However, I do not think that our brains\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\n\n> the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered.

I suggest, however, that before trying to\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \n\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\nconscious. \n\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\n\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn\'t.\n\n> The other problem with algorithms is their instability.

Don\'t forget this. This does not\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\nTheir primary \'purpose\' is perception and guidance of action, \nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\n\n> The next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?"

Is colour a mixture of these?\n\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of \'green\' in\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\nnot how I see it. The sensation \'green\' is a certain time-dependent\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \n\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\nbut this is just idle speculation.\n\nScientific American\'s September 1992 issue was a special issue on\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \ninterested.\n\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\nmind.\n\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \npatients\' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\n\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\ntherapist.\n\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\n\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\n\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\n\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\n   of our \'conscious will\' by at least 350 ms. \n\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question "Why do \'I\' see\ncolours" around and ask "What is this \'I\' that seems to be \nobserving?", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\nthe king of our brains.\n\n> If this is so, a\n> computer won\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different.

(A bit extreme,\nbut this is the basic idea.)\n\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \na sense of identity and the concept of \'self\' had to evolve in\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \n\n> If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\n> with two processes acting on it.

In\n    general, however, systems connected to \'the net\' fall in one of three\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\n    special \'servers\'.\n\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\n\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\n\n    A second mechanism is Usenet \'netnews\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\n    \'group name\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\n    called \'sci.space.news\', \'sci.space\', \'sci.space.shuttle\', \'sci.astro\',\n    and \'talk.politics.space\'. Contributors \'post\' submissions (called\n    \'articles\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\n    posted.\n\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\n    it the preferred option.\n\nMAILING LISTS\n\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\n    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body\n    should be in the format \'subscribe space John Public\') to join. Note\n    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of\n    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are\n    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve\n\tjulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README\n    for further details.\n\n    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle\n    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line\n    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources\n    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.\n\n    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning\n    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to\n    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.\n\n    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in\n    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.\n\n    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;\n    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid\n    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to\n    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and\n    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from\n    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,\n    or by email to space-tech-request if you don\'t have FTP access.\n\n    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and\n    Development of Space and other interested parties.

Email saying "INDEX SEDS-L" to list the archive contents.\n\n    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status\n    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in\n    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro.

Additionally, \nthe pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. \nThat is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure \nstabilization is how centaur achieves the performance.

The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. \n\nThe Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur\ndoes.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.

That this would be absent from our school texts,\n   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion\n   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express\n   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were\n   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the\n   American psyche.\n   ...\n      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the\n   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited\n   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors\n   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged\n   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at\n   Albany Congress: "It would be a strange thing...if six nations\n   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union\n   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted\n   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should\n   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies."\n      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs\n   and congressional delegates in order to "hammer out a plan that he\n   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy."\n\nGrinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California\nat Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the\nAmerican Nation_ addresses this issue.\n--\nDoug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own.\n', "From: henry@zoo.toronto.edu (Henry Spencer)\nSubject: Re: Orion drive in vacuum -- how?\nOrganization: U of Toronto Zoology\nLines: 15\n\nIn article <1qn4bgINN4s7@mimi.UU.NET> goltz@mimi.UU.NET (James P.

Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\'s. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\'s minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development."\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

Rushdie was writing\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\nthe actor "Gibreel" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It\'s somewhat like\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the\nArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens\nof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\nconsider Salman Rushdie\'s children\'s book "Haroun and the Sea of\nStories" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\n\n>to ridicule Muhammad\'s integrity...\n\nNo.  Muhammad\'s [Mahound\'s] integrity is not really impugned in this\npart of the story, and there\'s no reason to think this was Rushdie\'s\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\nsatanic), though he doesn\'t know their provenance.  It is not implied\n(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:\n\n    " *Not my voice* I\'d never know such words I\'m no classy speaker\n    never was never will be but this isn\'t my voice it\'s a Voice.\n      Mahound\'s eyes open wide, he\'s seeing some kind of vision,\n    staring at it, oh, that\'s right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He\'s\n    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don\'t\n    know, can\'t say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my\n    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.\n      Being God\'s postman is no fun, yaar.\n      Butbutbut: God isn\'t in this picture.\n      God knows whose postman I\'ve been."\n\nIt\'s ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\n\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very\nexistence of a newsgroup named "alt.atheism" raises the same\nquestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is\nthe real relevance.  If Rushdie\'s mild fictional exploration is "filth\nand lies", and he "asked for what he got", are we next on the fatwa\nlist?

This is often\ninterpreted as the much weaker term religion. \n\nThe atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews,\nMushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a\ndin you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social\ncode. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict,\netc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent\nthose assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other\nMushriq, or roughly polytheists. \n\nThere cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community,\nthat community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate \nthe society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or "Progress is \nthe natural consequence of Human activity" or "parlamentarian\ndemocracy is doubtlessly the best way of government", however \nthey individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point\nof view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist. \n"We are a atheist society" in fact means "we reject the din other than\nours". \n\nAtheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/\nsuppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that\nis a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such\ndeviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of\nlooking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level. \n\nI think it took more than one minute.\n\nKutluk\n', "From: palmer@cco.caltech.edu (David M.

We don't see this, so if they\nare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in\nradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda\nGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\nmind...\n\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\nintended for.\n\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\nkill by their leaders.\n\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \n\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\nparts of Man's history.@\n\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\n\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\n\n-ciao\n\n-chris blask\n", 'From: Keith.Stein@f118.n109.z1.permanet.org (Keith Stein)\nSubject: Re: Gps launch\nLines: 3\n\nNext GPS launch is scheduled for June 24th.\n\n * Origin: No. VA Astronomy Club 703-256-4777 (1:109/118)\n', 'From: dpage@ra.csc.ti.com (Doug Page)\nSubject: Re: Sr-71 in propoganda films?\nNntp-Posting-Host: ra\nOrganization: Texas Instruments\nDistribution: sci\nLines: 28\n\nIn article <1993Apr5.220610.1532@sequent.com>, bigfoot@sequent.com (Gregory Smith) writes:\n|> mccall@mksol.dseg.ti.com (fred j mccall 575-3539) writes:\n|> \n|> >In <1phv98$jbk@access.digex.net> prb@access.digex.com (Pat) writes:\n|> \n|> \n|> >>THe SR-71 stopped being a real secret by the mid 70\'s.\n|> >>I had a friend in high school who had a poster with it\'s picture.\n|> \n|> >It was known well before that.

I\'ve \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\n\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\nslots.\n\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\nsupporting Tonga\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \nthe Pacific Rim. \n\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\'t think I\'ll visit there for a long time.\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\nthat people operate.  For example "everybody can sell you everything."  \nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\n\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\n\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \nSiberia (can\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\n\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \nspecifications, they\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\nnow.\n\nTidbits:\n\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\nthat "we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier."\n\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\nwithin 9 months.\n\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\n\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\npartly because we aren\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government "every two weeks" but we don\'t worry \nbecause we\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\nreally goes on in Russia we won\'t worry about their stability as much.\n\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the "equivalent" value in \nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\n\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\n\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\nhardware.\n\n-- \nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t    "Find a way or make one."\n\t             -attributed to Hannibal\n', 'From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nSubject: Re: ASTRONAUTS---What does weightlessness feel like?\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nX-Posted-From: algol.jsc.nasa.gov\nNNTP-Posting-Host: sol.ctr.columbia.edu\nLines: 81\n\n: In article <1993Apr29.121501@is.morgan.com>, jlieb@is.morgan.com (Jerry Liebelson) writes...\n: > I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like.

I was busy keeping my experiment\ngoing and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" of\ngravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn\'t really pay\nattention to physiology at that time.\n\nAfter about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one\nof the tricks I\'ve discovered to keep myself from getting motion\nsickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly\n-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,\nconcious motion for my experiment.

This does\nnot mean that the bicycle does not exist, it measn that the description\nwas incorrectly applied.\n \n The atheist says, "The descriptions of God that I have been presented with\nare contradictory, and hence describe something that cannot exist."\n Now, your position (so far as I can gather) is that God exists, but the\ndescriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions\nof It.\n This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and,\nwhen they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one,\nare told that it is a "Euclidean circle-square". Can they be blamed for\ndoubting rather strongly that this \'bicycle\' exists at all?\n\n>(I\'m not an objectivist, remember.)\n\n No kidding. :->\n\n Sincerely,\n\n Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu\n\n "The meek can *have* the Earth.

For one, your claim that everyone senses it\n#is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often.\n#And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it\n#is there unless evidence against it has been found.\n\nI have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an\nargument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the\nonly cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered\nby some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about\nfuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It\'s a good point, and I\'m thinking\nabout it.\n# \n#Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,\n#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that\n#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,\n#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject\n#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological\n#claim, you have to prove it.\n\nNonsense.  My "trick" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so \ndoes almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore \nthat A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we\ncan establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and\nthat the resulting system of values is self-consistent.\n\nNow get this:  "really is better" is an idealisation, a fictional model,\nin the same sense that "real material existence" is a fictional model. It\nmay or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful\n_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist \n"trick", to wit:\n\nI feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person\nI ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,\nor if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,\nthen it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing\nmore can be said.  \n\nI say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority\nseeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to\nmaximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that \na supermajority\'s carefully considered morality would be better than the \nterrorist\'s - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical\nrelativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is\nsimply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival\nanything in the world of religion.\n\n#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not\n#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by\n#>#others.\n#>\n#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively\n#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this\n#>is possible.

The\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\n\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\n\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\nsystems such as the so-called "Bus-1 spacecraft," the orbiter and Spacelab.\n\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\n\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\n\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\nManagement System.\n\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\n\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\n\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\n\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\npropulsion systems.\n\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\n\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\noperations costs, he said.\n\n¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\n\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 "decks" connected by a\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\nmodules, and other elements.  This "can" would have two fixed photo voltaic\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\nattitude.\n\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\'Connor\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\n\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\n\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\n\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\nmanagement options have been developed including:\n\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\ncommand.\n\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\nAdministrator.\n\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\nhand-picked program office.\n\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\nelement of the current program.\n\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\n\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\n\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\nand ground operations.\n\nWhat\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be "frozen" to begin the\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\nbe held May 3.\n\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\'Connor will take over the\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\nconsult with the SRT.

You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,\ncleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in\naddition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment \nmission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second \ntime.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a \nfew years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two \nservicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down \nand take it up again.\n\nBen\n\n", 'From: mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\nSubject: Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\nSummary: Hi.

Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can\'t find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\'t set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\'ll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5.

(Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you\'ve tried the above methods and they\'ve failed; it\'s not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\'t have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n\n\nmathew\nÿ\n', 'Organization: Penn State University\nFrom: John A.

The concepts of "right"\nand "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\n\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,\nveridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\n\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\'t be considered:\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\n\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\nthe first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\nirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\none cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\nvalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"\nof the position.\n\nSorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is\nthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,\nneither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold\ndifferent moral values (feelings).\n-----------------------------------\nJohn A.

I know you are better informed than that.  The US \nhas never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada \nfrom the Cubans\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion \nof a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  \nVietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess \nwe "invaded" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have \ninvaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles \nfor anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from \nSpain.\n\nSo if you mean by the word "invaded" some sort of military action where\nwe cross someone\'s border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally\n"invaded" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.\n(If some nation "invades" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be\ninvading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)

In other words,\na person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and\nCzechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one\nwho would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political \ndissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.\n\n"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik," you ask?  Well, it depends\non what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over\nfreedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you\nthan life itself; if you\'d rather die fighting for liberty than live\nunder a tyrant\'s heel, then yes, it\'s "bad" to be a peace-nik.\n\nThe problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are\nnot like them to be "bad" and "unconscionable".  I would not have any\nargument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and\nstayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with \nthe national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to\nlegitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and \nmany times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank\nhypocrisy!)

Obviously, time for me to\ntake another ISM class :-(\n\n  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave\na talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief\noverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of\nabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then\ngave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is \nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\nNeptune\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\n\n  He notes that the two recently discovered "Kuiper Belt" objects,\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\nideas about the formation of Earth\'s moon.  There is good evidence\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\'t), which can be used as evidence\nfor the impact theory.\n\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\'s \norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\nto be very hard to see.\n\n  I hope I haven\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see\na howling mistake, it\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.\n\n  By the way, he\'s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\nTitan 4 to send the probe on "just about a rectilinear trajectory"\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).

Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of\nsupporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too\nlong-term.  \n\n(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov\'t was forced upon it because\nof socialism in other countries.

I believe that market forces should\ndrive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But\nthe whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or\nsome countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So\nthe U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a\nlot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,\ndoesn\'t it?)\n\nBut this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to\ncost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new\ntechnology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,\ndespite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly\nearnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in\nnew technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little\nsense to try to save money.\n\nOf course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY\ndisagrees about that the wisdom should be.  \n\nIt\'s interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control\navailable in industry today were derived from Government projects.\nGANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes\nfrom DoD projects and their contractors.

It\'s more likely that the Moon will never\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\nmaterials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \nand it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat \nsink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\'s a very minor \nactivity in the global scope of things.\n\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\n\nWe don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\ncenturies, if not much longer.\n\nLuna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again. There\'s little glory in watching from a\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges.

Both spacecraft will team up with\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\n     Japan\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\nwhile within view on Earth.\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\'s project manager for the\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\n     "One of our main activities is developing the methodology\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\ncelestial objects," said Smith.\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\n     "There is a long history of radio astronomy using\nground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is to\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy."\n     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galactic\nnuclei, you\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\nthan you would expect."\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\nthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look further\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\'s\nparticipation in the project.\n     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians have\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\nscience mission.\n     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"\nhe said.\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\nambitious project, JPL\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\n     "Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\nscientifically exciting missions."\n                           ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n', 'From: bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (Bill Conner)\nSubject: Re: Gospel Dating\nNntp-Posting-Host: okcforum.osrhe.edu\nOrganization: Okcforum Unix Users Group\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\nLines: 16\n\nKeith M.

What would be the spectrum of an event which\nconverts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black\nholes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets\naren\'t quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which\nmodifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these\nmechanisms.

The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the\nright distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible\nto match that up with the distribution of GRB\'s.  If they got the\nwrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can\'t constrain any Oort-\ncloud GRB\'s at all.\n\nExecutive summary: we don\'t know enough to rule out out the Oort\ncloud.\n', 'From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye)\nSubject: Re: Radical Agnostic...

There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\nbasis or empirical evidence.

The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\nknowledge.

Others claim to be staying of their own free\nwill, but Jobs\' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.\n\nIn conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting\ninformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the\nindustry.  At times, he has claimed to "have hardware which will blow\nanything else away", while more recently he claims they have stopped\nmanufacturing their own.\n\nAgents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is\nequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and\npossibly Canon equipment.\n\nThe siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to\nother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as "Bill" and\nclaims to be the "MS-iah".\n\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\n"interpersonal computing" which rejects traditional roles.\n\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\nfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares\nthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own\napocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers\ncarry Jobs\' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling "I\nwant to welcome you to the \'Next World\' ".\n\n- - -- \nRoland J.

So, the\nfirst person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily\na murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently\nunreducable definition?

As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God\'s_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God\'s_will,_and_\n   not_let_God\'s_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God\'s will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord\'s creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It\'s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can\'t conclude that he\'s an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n\'truth\' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\'t to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage \'means\' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal\'s Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal\'s Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\'s version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose you\'re believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one\'s eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one\'s interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno "cost".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal\'s wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam\'s Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam\'s Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\'s \nRazor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam\'s Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam\'s Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn\'t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it\'s good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\'re cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\'s\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein\'s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n"I believe in Spinoza\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings."\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\nit he says:\n\n  "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task..."\n\nEinstein has also said:\n\n  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it."\n\nThe latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it."\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it\'s money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists\' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists\'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon\'t think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can\'t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just "is" (or "was").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n"A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn\'t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus\'s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel\'s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid (\'true\' or \'false\') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar \nParadox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This \nsentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn\'t tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?"\n\n GB: "I guess I\'m pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me."\n\n RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?"\n\n GB: "No, I don\'t know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God."\n\n RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?"\n\n GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I\'m just not\n      very high on atheists."\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle \'88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"\n(Bush\'s phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"\n \n EM: "It\'s bullshit."\n \n RS: "What is bullshit?"\n \n EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."\n \n RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue."\n\n EM: "You\'re welcome."\n\nAfter Bush\'s election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\nhis original statement, and wrote:\n\n  "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government."\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press\'s Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!

See the contacts file for more information.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn\'t the\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\n\nResponse:\n\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\nquotes; there are many more.\n\n  "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\n   needs them not."\n      - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785\n\n  "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\n\n  "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose."\n\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\n\n  "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\n   above it."\n\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",\n        Nov. 20, 1728\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\n\nResponse:\n\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\n\n   Article 11\n\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\nsuch as Charles Bevans\' "Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\nUnited States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\n\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it\'s hard to say.\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.\n\n\nEnd of FAQ Digest\n*****************\nÿ\n', 'From: bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine)\nSubject: Re: "Cruel" (was Re: <Political Atheists?)\nOrganization: Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, Or.\nLines: 20\n\nIn article <1ql8mdINN674@gap.caltech.edu> keith@cco.caltech.edu (Keith Allan Schneider) writes:\n>\n>But we were discussing it in relation to the death penalty.

If we\ncan\'t measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics\naren\'t objective either.  That\'s what I mean when I say there\'s no objective\nphysics.\n\nSure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that\'s maths.  It\'s only\nphysics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can\'t do that\nobjectively, we\'re stuck.

Yes, we call that experimental error, but it\'s not\nreally "error" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don\'t get any,\nthat\'s an error :-)\n\nYou could argue that the value of c is "objective, to within +/- <some\nvalue>".  But I\'d call that a rather odd usage of the word "objective", and\nit opens the way for statements like "Murder is objectively wrong for all\npeople, to within 1% of the total population."\n\n\nmathew\n', "From: sysmgr@king.eng.umd.edu (Doug Mohney)\nSubject: Re: Commercial mining activities on the moon\nOrganization: Computer Aided Design Lab, U. of Maryland College Park\nLines: 10\nReply-To: sysmgr@king.eng.umd.edu\nNNTP-Posting-Host: queen.eng.umd.edu\n\nIn article <STEINLY.93Apr20160116@topaz.ucsc.edu>, steinly@topaz.ucsc.edu (Steinn Sigurdsson) writes:\n\n>Very cost effective if you use the right accounting method :-)\n\nSherzer Methodology!!!!!!\n\n\n\n    Software engineering?

What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n", 'From: kmr4@po.CWRU.edu (Keith M.
